#### How to Tutorial

## 2. Compatibility with .NET Framework & .NET Core

IronPDF streamlines the creation and manipulation of PDF files by providing intuitive .NET-compatible methods, enhancing both productivity and development speed across .NET Core and .NET Framework, suitable for projects using .NET Framework version 4 or higher and .NET Core version 2 or higher.

## 3. Intuitive Naming Conventions for Easy PDF Creation

The advantages of the IronPDF library include:
- **Speed**: IronPDF optimizes the PDF creation process, allowing developers to achieve results faster and improve productivity.
- **Simplicity**: The library's methods are well-named and self-explanatory, making it straightforward for developers, from novices to veterans, to generate PDFs efficiently in either VB.NET or C#.

## 4. Generate PDF from HTML String

Creating a PDF from an HTML string is straightforward with IronPDF:

```cs
// Generate a PDF from an HTML string using IronPDF
private void ConvertHtmlToPdf()
{
    var pdfRenderer = new IronPdf.ChromePdfRenderer();
    using var document = pdfRenderer.RenderHtmlAsPdf("<h1>Welcome to IronPDF</h1>");
    var outputPath = "ResultingPdfDocument.pdf";
    document.SaveAs(outputPath); 
}
```

This code snippet efficiently transforms HTML code into a PDF document, utilizing clearly named methods such as `ChromePdfRenderer`, `RenderHtmlAsPdf`, and `SaveAs`.

## 5. Generate PDF from ASPX

Easily generate a PDF from ASPX pages without additional libraries using IronPDF:

```cs
// Convert ASPX to PDF directly
protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf();
}
```

## 6. Advanced JavaScript Support

IronPDF is robust, supporting advanced features like JavaScript and responsive design essential for modern web applications, thus eliminating the need for multiple PDF conversion tools.

## 7. Generate PDF with Customized Viewport

Hereâ€™s how to set a custom viewport size during PDF generation:

```cs
// Custom viewport settings for HTML to PDF conversion
using IronPdf;
var pdfRenderer = new IronPdf.ChromePdfRenderer();
pdfRenderer.RenderingOptions.CssMediaType = IronPdf.Rendering.PdfCssMediaType.Screen;
pdfRenderer.ViewPortWidth = 1280;
pdfRenderer.RenderHTMLFileAsPdf("Assets/Responsive.html");
```

Support for JavaScript is enhanced by setting a delay to allow for script processing:

```cs
pdfRenderer.RenderingOptions.EnableJavaScript = true;
pdfRenderer.RenderingOptions.RenderDelay = 500; // milliseconds
```
