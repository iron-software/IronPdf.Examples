# How to Convert HTML Strings to PDF in .NET

IronPDF empowers .NET developers, including those using C#, F#, and VB.NET, working with both .NET Core and .NET Framework, to easily generate PDF documents. It accomplishes this by turning HTML strings into PDFs utilizing a robust version of the Google Chromium engine.

## Example: Converting HTML to PDF

This example showcases how to use IronPDF to convert an HTML string into a PDF document using the `RenderHtmlAsPdf()` method. The method accepts an HTML string which will be transformed into a PDF.

```cs
using IronPdf;

// Initialize the PDF renderer
var pdfRenderer = new ChromePdfRenderer();

// Convert an HTML string into a PDF document
var myPdf = pdfRenderer.RenderHtmlAsPdf("<h1>Hello World</h1>");

// Save the PDF to a file
myPdf.SaveAs("output.pdf");
```

In scenarios where the HTML content comes from an outside source, enhancing security by disabling local disk access or cross-origin requests is possible by setting `Installation.EnableWebSecurity` to `true`.

### Output Example

The below file is the result generated by the above code:

## Advanced Example: HTML to PDF with Assets

In this advanced example, IronPDF demonstrates how to handle HTML content that includes external assets such as images, CSS, or JavaScript. By setting the `BaseUrlOrPath` property, you establish a context for where these files are sourced from or stored.

```cs
using IronPdf;

// Create a new renderer instance
var advancedRenderer = new ChromePdfRenderer();

// More Complex Example: Incorporating external HTML assets
// Specify the base path for assets
// This HTML includes an image that is loaded from a specified path
var detailedPdf = advancedRenderer.RenderHtmlAsPdf("<img src='icons/iron.png'>", @"C:\site\assets\");
detailedPdf.SaveAs("html-with-assets.pdf");
```

Here is the produced file from the above advanced example:
