# Unable to Initialize OLE (Error Code: 80010106)

***Based on <https://ironpdf.com/how-to/could-not-initialize-ole-error/>***


This alert commonly appears in the development consoles when employing IronPDF outside the context of Windows Forms or WPF applications.

You'll often see this notification within the consoles of **.NET Core web applications** or any **Console Application**. What exactly does this mean?

## Understanding the Error: Is There an Issue with the Software?

The message originates from the embedded Google Chrome-based browser that IronPDF utilizes. It indicates that the application is running without displaying a visible browser window, which is exactly how it's designed to function.

Integrating such a sophisticated HTML rendering engine does come with minor inconveniences such as this message. Unfortunately, at this moment, we cannot eliminate this message, but itâ€™s important to note that it is completely benign. Rest assured, your application is operating correctly and as expected.
