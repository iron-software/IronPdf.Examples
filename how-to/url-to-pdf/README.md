## Example of Converting a URL to PDF

Below is an example of how IronPDF can be used to convert a [Wikipedia page into a PDF document](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page). The `RenderUrlAsPdf()` method is employed here, taking a fully-qualified Uri, which is the URL of the webpage you want to convert to PDF.

```cs
using IronPdf;

// Create a new PDF renderer instance
var pdfRenderer = new ChromePdfRenderer();

// Convert a URL to a PDF document
var pdfDocument = pdfRenderer.RenderUrlAsPdf("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page");

// Save the PDF to a local file
pdfDocument.SaveAs("converted-url.pdf");
```
