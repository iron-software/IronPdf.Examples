## 1.2. Install IronPDF by DLL Download

Alternatively, IronPDF can be directly downloaded and installed as described below:

1. Download and extract the Windows IronPDF DLL package from [here](https://ironpdf.com/packages/IronPdf.zip) to a preferable location such as ~/Libs in your Solution directory.
2. In Visual Studio Solution Explorer, right-click 'Dependencies' and choose 'Add Project Reference'. Navigate to and select all the DLLs unpacked from the zip.

Links to IronPDF DLL zip packages for different platforms can be found here:

- [Windows](https://ironpdf.com/packages/IronPdf.zip)
- [Linux](https://ironpdf.com/packages/IronPdf.Linux.zip)
- [MacOS](https://ironpdf.com/packages/IronPdf.MacOs.zip)

### Implementing Your License Key

Insert the following code early in your application's startup sequence to apply the IronPDF license key:

```cs
IronPdf.License.LicenseKey = "YOUR-IRONPDF-LICENSE-KEY";
```

For different methods of applying the license key, refer to our ['IronPDF License Keys Guide'](https://ironpdf.com/how-to/license-keys/).

## 2. Modifying Access Permissions for Files or Folders

Configuring user or role permissions on your system might be necessary.

Applications hosted in the same [AppPool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/manage/configuring-security/application-pool-identities) as well as those across different [AppDomains](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/app-domains/application-domains) each require their unique [TempFolderPath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporary_folder).

To set up these permissions:

1. Right-click the required file or folder
2. Click Properties > Security
3. Choose Editâ€¦
4. Adjust the permissions as needed.

<hr class="separator">

## 3. Choosing an Installation Path

IronPDF operates by embedding Chromium to convert [HTML to PDF](https://ironpdf.com/tutorials/html-to-pdf/). This is fully automated, but it's vital to select an appropriate installation path to avoid errors.

### Specifying `IronPdf.Installation.TempFolderPath`

Define the installation path as follows:

`IronPdf.Installation.TempFolderPath = @"C:\Your\Preferred\Path";`

Always clear your temporary and cache directories after updating paths and redeploy a clean version of your application.

### Configuring the System Environment Variables

Set the following environment variables to manage temporary file locations throughout your application:

```cs
using IronPdf;

// Set the path for application scope temporary files.
var MyTempPath = @"C:\Optimal\Path\";
Environment.SetEnvironmentVariable("TEMP", MyTempPath, EnvironmentVariableTarget.Process);
Environment.SetEnvironmentVariable("TMP", MyTempPath, EnvironmentVariableTarget.Process);

// Define the IronPDF temporary path.
IronPdf.Installation.TempFolderPath = System.IO.Path.Combine(MyTempPath, "IronPdf");

// Proceed with PDF generation and editing.
var Renderer = new IronPdf.ChromePdfRenderer();
using var Doc = Renderer.RenderHtmlAsPdf("<h1>Your HTML Content Here</h1>");
Doc.SaveAs("example.pdf");
```

## 4. Permissions and IIS

Grant necessary read and write permissions to the IIS user (IUSER) for both your Installation and Windows Temp Folders, ensuring smooth operation within secured servers.

<hr class="separator">

## 5. Requirement for Microsoft Visual C++ on Windows

To run IronPDF effectively, ensure that Microsoft Visual C++ is installed on your Windows system. This component can usually be found on any advanced Windows installation and is a crucial part for both 32 and 64-bit compatibility.
