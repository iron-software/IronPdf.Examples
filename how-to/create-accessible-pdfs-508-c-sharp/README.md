# Enhancing PDF Accessibility & Adhering to Section 508 Standards

***Based on <https://ironpdf.com/how-to/create-accessible-pdfs-508-c-sharp/>***


IronPDF is committed to supporting Google's initiative to enhance the accessibility of PDF documents and meet Section 508 compliance standards.

As of 2021, we have adopted the Google Chromium HTML rendering engine for converting HTML to PDFs. This transition allows our tools to leverage [the accessibility improvements already incorporated by Google](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/07/using-chrome-to-generate-more.html).

We recognize that the Tagged PDF and PDF/UA standards are relatively recent developments, and we are diligently working to integrate as much of this functionality into our API as possible. At present, our users can create documents compliant with the PDF/A-3b standard. Detailed guidance on this process can be found in [our tutorial on using the PDF/A Archiving export standard with IronPDF](https://ironpdf.com/how-to/pdfa/).

Should you have any suggestions on how we can further refine this API, please do not hesitate to contact our developer support team.
