# Enhancing PDF Accessibility & Adhering to Section 508 Standards

At IronPDF, we are enthusiastic supporters of Google's initiative to enhance the accessibility of PDF documents and ensure compliance with Section 508 standards.

Starting in 2021, we adopted the Google Chromium HTML rendering engine for converting HTML into PDFs. This significant upgrade allows our tools to benefit from [the accessibility improvements already integrated by Google](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/07/using-chrome-to-generate-more.html).

While Tagged PDF and PDF/UA standards are relatively recent developments, we are committed to incorporating these standards into our API to the fullest extent possible. At present, our software supports exporting documents in compliance with the PDF/A-3b standard. We have outlined the detailed steps for utilizing the PDF/A Archiving export standard with IronPDF in [our dedicated guide](https://ironpdf.com/how-to/pdfa/).

Should you have any suggestions on enhancing our API, or if you encounter any issues, please reach out to our developer support team.
