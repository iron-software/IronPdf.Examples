# Initializing and Operating IronPdfEngine

To initialize and operate an IronPdfEngine image, you need to download the pre-configured container image from sources such as Dockerhub, AWS ECR Public Gallery, or AWS Marketplace, and then run it in a Docker setup.

**Pulling**: This involves downloading the IronPdfEngine container image from a registry like Dockerhub, AWS ECR Public Gallery, or AWS Marketplace onto your local machine using the `docker pull` command.

**Running**: After downloading the image, you deploy it by using the `docker run` command. This command launches a Docker container instance using the IronPdfEngine image, activating the IronPdfEngine service within the container.

## Fetching IronPdfEngine from Dockerhub

### Precondition
* Ensure Docker is installed on your system.

### Configuration Steps
1. Visit [IronPdfEngine on Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ironsoftwareofficial/ironpdfengine).
2. Download the `ironsoftwareofficial/ironpdfengine` image:
```shell
docker pull ironsoftwareofficial/ironpdfengine
```
Alternatively, download a specific version (recommended):
```shell
docker pull ironsoftwareofficial/ironpdfengine:2023.12.6
```
3. Launch the `ironsoftwareofficial/ironpdfengine` container. The following command runs the container in the background, binding it to port 33350:
```shell
docker run -d -p 33350:33350 ironsoftwareofficial/ironpdfengine
```

## Implementing IronPdfEngine Using Docker Compose

Establish a Docker network for connectivity between IronPdfEngine and your application, and use `depends_on` to ensure IronPdfEngine launches prior to your app.

### Configuration Steps

1. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file. Use the following template to set up your Docker Compose environment:
```yml
version: "3.6"
services:
  myironpdfengine:
    container_name: ironpdfengine
    image: ironsoftwareofficial/ironpdfengine:latest
    ports:
      - "33350:33350"
    networks:
      - ironpdf-network
  myconsoleapp:
    container_name: myconsoleapp
    build:
      context: ./MyConsoleApp/
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    networks:
      - ironpdf-network
    depends_on:
      - myironpdfengine
networks:
  ironpdf-network: 
    driver: "bridge"
```

2. Define your app's IronPdfEngine connection point:
```shell
docker compose up --detach --force-recreate --remove-orphans --timestamps
```

## Acquiring IronPdfEngine Via AWS ECR Public Gallery

### Precondition
* Docker and AWS CLI must be installed and configured.

### Configuration Steps
1. Navigate to [IronPdfEngine in AWS ECR Gallery](https://gallery.ecr.aws/v1m9w8y1/ironpdfengine).
2. Download the `v1m9w8y1/ironpdfengine` image:
```shell
docker pull gallery.ecr.aws/v1m9w8y1/ironpdfengine
```
Or download a specific version (recommended):
```shell
docker pull gallery.ecr.aws/v1m9w8y1/ironpdfengine:2023.12.6
```
3. Launch the `ironpdfengine` container, running it in the background on port 33350:
```shell
docker run -d -p 33350:33350 ironsoftwareofficial/ironpdfengine
```
