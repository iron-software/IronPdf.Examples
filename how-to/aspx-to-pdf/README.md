## 2. PDF Conversion of ASP.NET Web Pages

Begin by setting up a standard "Web Form" in ASPX that outputs HTML. This example uses the "Invoice.aspx" source, which outputs a basic HTML-rendered invoice as an ASP.NET web page complete with CSS stylesheets, and potentially images and JavaScript.

To convert this web page into a PDF rather than HTML, incorporate the following code snippet into the ***Page_Load*** event within your C# (or VB.NET) code:

```cs
IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.InBrowser);
```

This code snippet will render the HTML content as a PDF directly in the browser, maintaining all elements such as hyperlinks, stylesheets, images, and HTML forms. This conversion leverages Chromium, the same web browser technology behind Google Chrome, ensuring high fidelity PDF output.

Here's how the complete C# code structure appears: Converting an ASPX Page to PDF using Active Server Pages.

```cs
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Web;
using System.Web.UI; 
using System.Web.UI.WebControls;
using IronPdf;

namespace AspxToPdfTutorial
{
    public partial class Invoice : System.Web.UI.Page
    {
        protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.InBrowser);
        }
    }
}
```

## 2. Transforming ASP.NET Web Pages into PDF Documents

To begin, let's work with a standard ASPX "Web Form," displayed initially as HTML. Later, we'll convert this ASPX page into a PDF document.

For demonstration, consider the accompanying source code example where we've transformed "Invoice.aspx" into a straightforward HTML business invoice, presented as an ASP.NET page.

The specified HTML page is enhanced with CSS3 stylesheets and could incorporate images and JavaScript for enriched formatting and functionality.

To convert this ASP.NET web page to a PDF instead of HTML, we simply modify the C# (or VB.NET) source code within the **Page_Load** event as follows:

Here is the paraphrased section of the article:

```cs
// Renders the current page as a PDF and opens it within the browser
IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.InBrowser);
```

Here is the paraphrased section of your article:

---
That's all it takes to convert your HTML to a PDF—hyperlinks, stylesheets, images, and even HTML forms remain intact. The resulting PDF closely mimics what one would expect if they had used the print-to-PDF function in their own web browser. IronPDF leverages the robust Chromium web browser technology, the same that underpins Google Chrome, to facilitate this conversion.

Below is the complete C# code snippet for converting an ASPX page into a PDF within Active Server Pages:

Here's a paraphrased version of the provided C# code snippet, including relevant using directives and the namespace declaration, with variant formatting and structure in the code:

```cs
using System;
using System.Linq;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Web;
using System.Web.UI;
using System.Web.UI.WebControls;
using IronPdf;

namespace AspxToPdfTutorial
{
    public partial class Invoice : Page
    {
        protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            var pdfRenderer = new IronPdf.AspxToPdf();
            pdfRenderer.RenderThisPageAsPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.InBrowser);
        }
    }
}
```

In this version, the `pdfRenderer` variable is introduced to hold the instance of `IronPdf.AspxToPdf`, providing slightly more clarity and separation in the code structure. Additionally, the base class `Page` is used explicitly instead of `System.Web.UI.Page` for brevity but with the same effect.

Here's the paraphrased version of the specified section, with the URL resolved against ironpdf.com:


## 3. Customize ASPX to PDF Conversion Settings

When converting an ASPX file to PDF using .NET Web Forms, numerous configurable settings allow for precise adjustments to the output.

Explore these settings in detail at the [IronPDF API Reference](https://ironpdf.com/object-reference/api/IronPdf.html).
```
This text maintains the intent and information of the original section while adjusting the wording and structure.

### 3.1. Configure PDF Display Behavior

The "**InBrowser**" setting aims to display the PDF directly within the user's web browser. However, not all browsers may support this feature, although it is generally available in modern browsers that adhere to current web standards.

Here is the paraphrased content for the specific section:

```
IronPdf.AspxToPdf.ConvertToPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileAction.DisplayInBrowser);
```

**Attachment** mode ensures that the PDF is downloaded onto the user's device.

```csharp
IronPdf.AspxToPdf.ConvertToPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.Attachment);
```

## How to Convert ASPX to PDF

ASP.NET (ASPX) websites are typically utilized for creating complex sites, including online banking systems, intranets, and account management systems. A key functionality for these sites is generating dynamic PDF documents—like invoices, tickets, or reports—for easy downloading by users.

Our guide explores the use of IronPDF, a dedicated .NET library, to transform any ASP.NET web form into a PDF file. The process involves rendering HTML—usually displayed as a web page—into a PDF document, which can be downloaded or viewed directly within a browser. The accompanying source project provides a practical example of converting a web page to a PDF using C#.

Convert HTML to PDF seamlessly with the help of IronPDF and its [`AspxToPdf` Class](https://ironpdf.com/object-reference/api/IronPdf.AspxToPdf.html).

### Step 1: Install the Free ASPX File Converter from IronPDF

#### Install via NuGet

In the Visual Studio environment, right-click on your solution in the solution explorer and choose "Manage NuGet Packages...". Search for IronPDF and proceed to install the latest version, accepting any pop-ups that appear.

This method is compatible with C# .NET Framework projects, starting from version 4.6.2, .NET Core 2, and also works in VB.NET projects.

[Download IronPDF from NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/IronPdf)

#### Install via DLL

As an alternative, you can directly download the IronPDF DLL and install it either in your project or the Global Assembly Cache (GAC) from [this link](https://ironpdf.com/packages/IronPdf.zip).

Don't forget to include this statement at the beginning of your `.cs` files:

```cs
using IronPdf;
```

### Step 2: Convert ASP.NET Webpages to PDF

Begin by using a standard ASPX "Web Form,” which initially renders in HTML format. Our goal is to convert this page into a PDF.

For illustration, consider a basic business invoice (`Invoice.aspx`), formatted in HTML and ASP.NET. This page may include CSS3 styles, images, and JavaScript.

To convert the web form into a PDF instead of HTML, update the `Page_Load` event in your C# or VB.NET code like this:

```cs
IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.InBrowser);
```

This simple addition is enough to render your HTML as a PDF document. Features like hyperlinks, stylesheets, images, and forms will remain intact. Essentially, the outcome will be similar to what a user would get by printing the HTML page to PDF directly in their browser. IronPDF leverages the same underlying technology as the Chrome browser.

Here is what the complete C# code segment looks like:

```cs
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Web;
using System.Web.UI;
using System.Web.UI.WebControls;
using IronPdf;

namespace AspxToPdfTutorial
{
    public partial class Invoice : System.Web.UI.Page
    {
        protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.InBrowser);
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Customize ASPX File to PDF Conversion Settings

Numerous customization options are available when converting an ASPX file to a PDF using .NET Web Forms.

These settings are comprehensively documented in the [IronPDF API Reference](https://ironpdf.com/object-reference/api/IronPdf.html).

### 3.3. Modify PDF Printing Settings

You can manipulate the final appearance of your PDF by incorporating an instance of the `IronPdf.ChromePdfRenderer` class. Detailed documentation for this class can be viewed at [ChromePdfRenderer API Reference](https://ironpdf.com/object-reference/api/IronPdf.ChromePdfRenderer.html).

Below is a paraphrased version of the provided C# code snippet that demonstrates how to set options for rendering a PDF from an ASPX page using IronPDF:

```cs
// Configure PDF rendering options
var pdfOptions = new IronPdf.ChromePdfRenderOptions()
{
    EnableJavaScript = false, // Disables JavaScript
    // Additional options can be configured here
};

// Render the ASPX page as a PDF with specified options
IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.Attachment, "Invoice.pdf", pdfOptions);
``` 

This block of code creates an instance of `ChromePdfRenderOptions` and disables JavaScript for the PDF conversion process. It then calls `RenderThisPageAsPdf` to convert the current ASPX page to a PDF file named `Invoice.pdf` with the specified options, which will be downloaded as an attachment.

The variety of PDF rendering options provided includes:

- **CreatePdfFormsFromHtml**: Converts ASPX form elements into editable PDF forms.
- **CssMediaType**: Allows you to choose between `Screen` or `Print` CSS styles for your Stylesheets. View our [detailed guide with comparative visuals](https://ironpdf.com/how-to/pixel-perfect-html-to-pdf/).
- **CustomCssUrl**: Enables the application of a custom CSS stylesheet to the HTML before it's rendered. This could be a local file path or a remote URL.
- **EnableMathematicalLaTex**: Switches the rendering of mathematical LaTeX elements on or off.
- **EnableJavaScript**: Activates the execution of JavaScript and JSON prior to rendering the page, which is particularly useful for Ajax or Angular-based applications. For more details, visit the [WaitFor how-to guide](https://ironpdf.com/how-to/waitfor/).
- **Javascript**: Allows for the execution of a custom JavaScript string just after all HTML is loaded and before the PDF is rendered.
- **JavascriptMessageListener**: Implements a method callback that is triggered whenever a message is available in the browser's JavaScript console.
- **FirstPageNumber**: Sets the starting page number for headers and footers, with a default setting of 1.
- **TableOfContents**: Generates a table of contents at the specified HTML element with id "ironpdf-toc".

- **Margin Configuration**: Allows setting of the PDF margins (top, bottom, left, right) in millimeters, with an option to go borderless.
- **UseMarginsOnHeaderAndFooter**: Determines whether to apply document margins to the headers and footers.
- **PaperFit**: Controls how content is formatted within the PDF "paper," including options like Default Chrome Behavior, Zooming, Responsive CSS3 Layouts, Scale-To-Page, and Continuous Feed.
- **PaperOrientation**: Specifies the orientation of the PDF paper - either *Landscape* or *Portrait*.
- **PageRotation**: Handles page rotation settings from existing documents with a [detailed guide and code example](https://ironpdf.com/examples/pdf-page-orientation/).
- **PaperSize** and **CustomPaperSize**: Allows you to set standard or custom paper sizes in centimeters, inches, millimeters, pixels, or points.
- **ForcePaperSize**: Forces pages to match specified dimensions in the PaperSize setting by resizing after HTML to PDF conversion.
- **PrintHtmlBackgrounds**: Enables printing of HTML backgrounds.
- **GrayScale**: Produces a greyscale PDF, using shades of grey rather than full color.
- **WaitFor**: Configures delays and waiting conditions to improve render outcomes during dynamic content loading. Options include waiting for page load, custom delays, font loading, JavaScript execution, HTML element visibility, or network idle conditions.
- **Title**: Sets the 'Title' metadata for the PDF document.
- **InputEncoding**: Defines the character encoding for input, with [UTF-8 as the default for ASP.NET](https://ironpdf.com/how-to/utf-8/).
- **RequestContext**: Sets the request context for the rendering process.
- **Timeout**: Establishes a maximum rendering time in seconds, ensuring operations don't run indefinitely.

## 4. Incorporating Headers & Footers into ASPX PDFs

IronPDF facilitates the addition of headers and footers to the PDFs you create.

The most straightforward approach involves using the `TextHeaderFooter` class. This class enables a simple layout that can dynamically incorporate data such as the current date and page numbers into the PDF document.

### 4.1. Example of Adding Headers and Footers to ASPX PDFs

Using IronPDF, you can effortlessly incorporate headers and footers into your PDF documents. 

Here's a straightforward method employing the *TextHeaderFooter* class, enabling the integration of dynamic content such as time stamps and page numbering easily:

```cs
using IronSoftware.Drawing;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Web;
using System.Web.UI;
using System.Web.UI.WebControls;

namespace AspxToPdfTutorial
{
    public partial class Invoice : System.Web.UI.Page
    {
        protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            var pdfOptions = new IronPdf.ChromePdfRenderOptions()
            {
                TextHeader = new IronPdf.TextHeaderFooter()
                {
                    CenterText = "Invoice",
                    DrawDividerLine = false,
                    Font = FontTypes.Arial,
                    FontSize = 12,
                },
                TextFooter = new IronPdf.TextHeaderFooter()
                {
                    LeftText = "{date} - {time}",
                    RightText = "Page {page} of {total-pages}",
                    Font = IronSoftware.Drawing.FontTypes.Arial,
                    FontSize = 12,
                },
            };
            IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.Attachment, "Invoice.pdf", pdfOptions);
        }
    }
}
```

Alternatively, for more intricate styling needs, the HtmlHeaderFooter class allows the use of HTML, CSS, images, and hyperlinks to design headers and footers:

```cs
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Web;
using System.Web.UI;
using System.Web.UI.WebControls;

namespace AspxToPdfTutorial
{
    public partial class Invoice : System.Web.UI.Page
    {
        protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            var pdfOptions = new IronPdf.ChromePdfRenderOptions()
            {
                MarginTop = 50, // allow ample space for an HTML header
                HtmlHeader = new IronPdf.HtmlHeaderFooter()
                {
                    HtmlFragment = "<div style='text-align:right'><em style='color:pink'>Page {page} of {total-pages}</em></div>"
                }
            };
            IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.Attachment, "MyDocument.pdf", pdfOptions);
        }
    }
}
```

In our examples, placeholders, like `{page}` and `{total-pages}`, are used to merge dynamic text or HTML into headers and footers, optimizing the customization of PDF documents.

```cs
using IronSoftware.Drawing;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Web;
using System.Web.UI;
using System.Web.UI.WebControls;

namespace AspxToPdfTutorial
{
    public partial class Invoice : System.Web.UI.Page
    {
        protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // Options for rendering PDF with headers and footers
            var pdfOptions = new IronPdf.ChromePdfRenderOptions()
            {
                // Configure header with title and no dividing line
                TextHeader = new IronPdf.TextHeaderFooter()
                {
                    CenterText = "Invoice",
                    DrawDividerLine = false,
                    Font = FontTypes.Arial,
                    FontSize = 12
                },
                // Configure footer with dynamic text including date, time, and page numbers
                TextFooter = new IronPdf.TextHeaderFooter()
                {
                    LeftText = "{date} - {time}",
                    RightText = "Page {page} of {total-pages}",
                    Font = IronSoftware.Drawing.FontTypes.Arial,
                    FontSize = 12,
                },
            };
            // Execute the rendering of the ASPX page to PDF with specified file name and options
            IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.Attachment, "Invoice.pdf", pdfOptions);
        }
    }
}
```

using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Web;
using System.Web.UI;
using System.Web.UI.WebControls;

namespace AspxToPdfTutorial
{
    public partial class Invoice : System.Web.UI.Page
    {
        protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // Define PDF rendering options for ASPX to PDF conversion
            var pdfRenderOptions = new IronPdf.ChromePdfRenderOptions()
            {
                MarginTop = 50,  // Allocate sufficient space for a custom HTML header
                HtmlHeader = new IronPdf.HtmlHeaderFooter()
                {
                    HtmlFragment = "<div style='text-align: right;'><em style='color: pink;'>Page {page} of {total-pages}</em></div>"
                }
            };
            
            // Render the current ASPX page to a PDF named 'MyDocument.pdf' and provide it as an attachment
            IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.Attachment, "MyDocument.pdf", pdfRenderOptions);
        }
    }
}
```

In this paraphrase, I have refined the comments to enhance clarity and slightly adjusted the expression of the code for freshness without altering its functionality.

In our demonstrations, it's possible to incorporate dynamic text or HTML into the headers and footers by utilizing placeholders:

- `{page}`: shows the current page number within the PDF.
- `{total-pages}`: indicates the entire count of pages in the PDF.
- `{url}`: denotes the web URL from which the PDF was generated.
- `{date}`: identifies today's date, formatted according to the server's regional settings.
- `{time}`: displays the current time in hours and minutes using a 24-hour format.
- `{html-title}`: dynamically includes the *title* from the `<head>` tag of the ASPX web form.
- `{pdf-title}`: specifies the name of the PDF document being created.

## 5. Implementing Page Breaks in ASPX for PDF Conversion

In the nature of its design, HTML content often extends into a single continuous stream that adjusts according to browser window size. However, PDF documents are structured like traditional paper—fixed and paginated. To introduce manual pagination in your PDFs created from ASPX files, you can easily insert a page break by adding this snippet of HTML to your ASPX code. This ensures that the content preceding this tag will end at one PDF page, and the subsequent content will start fresh on the next page.

Here is the paraphrased content of the specified section, with the relative URL resolved to `ironpdf.com`:

```html
<div style='page-break-after: always;'>&nbsp;</div>
```

This HTML snippet inserts a forced page-break in a .NET generated PDF document when converting from an ASPX page. Perfect for ensuring content separation across multiple pages.

## 6. Enhancing Performance with Async and Multithreading

IronPDF supports both .NET Framework 4.6.2 and .NET Core 2 or higher versions. Projects that target .NET Framework 4.6.2 or newer can leverage [asynchronous programming techniques](https://ironpdf.com/how-to/async/) to enhance performance, especially when managing multiple documents concurrently.

Utilizing asynchronous methods along with the multi-threading capabilities of modern CPUs, specifically through the `Parallel.ForEach` method, can significantly boost the efficiency of processing large volumes of PDFs.
