```csharp
IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.InBrowser);
```

This command converts and renders the HTML as a PDF which retains all elements like hyperlinks, stylesheets, and even forms. It mimics the output you would get if you were to print the page as a PDF from a browser, utilizing the same Chromium technology behind Google Chrome.

#### Full C# Implementation

Here’s how to fully implement the conversion in an ASP.NET page:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Web;
using System.Web.UI;
using System.Web.UI.WebControls;
using IronPdf;

namespace AspxToPdfTutorial
{
    public partial class Invoice : System.Web.UI.Page
    {
        protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.InBrowser);
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. Customizing PDF Output

IronPDF provides extensive options for customizing the PDF output through the [API reference](https://ironpdf.com/object-reference/api/IronPdf.ChromePdfRenderer.html).

#### Setting File Behavior

- **InBrowser**: Attempt to display the PDF directly in the browser.
- **Attachment**: Force the PDF to be downloaded by the user.

```csharp
IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(fileBehavior: IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.Attachment, fileName: "Invoice.pdf");
```

#### Modifying Print Options

Adjust the rendering settings with `ChromePdfRenderOptions`:

```csharp
var pdfOptions = new IronPdf.ChromePdfRenderOptions()
{
    EnableJavaScript = true,
    CssMediaType = PrintOptions.Screen,
    // additional options...
};
IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(fileBehavior: IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.Attachment, fileName: "Invoice.pdf", options: pdfOptions);
```

### 4. Enhancing PDFs with Headers and Footers

Incorporate dynamic headers and footers using `TextHeaderFooter`. Here’s an example showing how to include automatic timestamps and pagination:

```csharp
using IronSoftware.Drawing;

public partial class Invoice : System.Web.UI.Page
{
    protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        var pdfOptions = new IronPdf.ChromePdfRenderOptions()
        {
            TextHeader = new TextHeaderFooter()
            {
                CenterText = "Invoice",
                Font = FontTypes.Arial,
                FontSize = 12
            },
            TextFooter = new TextHeaderFooter()
            {
                LeftText = "{date} - {time}",
                RightText = "Page {page} of {total-pages}",
                Font = FontTypes.Arial,
                FontSize = 12,
            },
        };

        IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.Attachment, "Invoice.pdf", pdfOptions);
    }
}
```

Optionally, create rich HTML headers and footers using `HtmlHeaderFooter`:

```csharp
public partial class Invoice : System.Web.UI.Page
{
    protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        var pdfOptions = new IronPdf.ChromePdfRenderOptions()
        {
            MarginTop = 50, // Allocate space for HTML header
            HtmlHeader = new HtmlHeaderFooter()
            {
                HtmlFragment = "<div style='text-align:right'><em style='color:pink'>page {page} of {total-pages}</em></div>"
            }
        };

        IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.Attachment, "MyDocument.pdf", pdfOptions);
    }
}
```

This detailed guide elucidates how developers can effectively leverage IronPDF for ASP.NET, transforming ASPX pages into functional and polished PDF documents.

## Converting ASP.NET Webpages to PDF Format

Begin by utilizing a standard ASPX "Web Form" that outputs HTML. Subsequently, this will be **transformed into a PDF document**.

Referencing our sample source code, you can see how we’ve transformed "Invoice.aspx", a straightforward HTML business invoice, into an ASP.NET Page.

The HTML of this page incorporates CSS3 styles, and may feature images and JavaScript as well.

To switch the output of this ASP.NET Web Page from HTML to a PDF, incorporate the following code into the ***Page_Load*** event of your C# or VB.NET application:

Here is the paraphrased section of the article:

```cs
// Render the current ASPX page as a PDF and display it within the browser
IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.InBrowser);
```

Here's the paraphrased section:

-----
This one-step process allows the HTML content, including Hyperlinks, StyleSheets, Images, and HTML forms, to be preserved in the PDF format. The result closely resembles what you would see if you manually initiated a print-to-PDF command in your browser. IronPDF leverages the power of the Chromium web technology, the same engine that drives the Google Chrome browser.

Here's the detailed C# example demonstrating the conversion of an ASPX page to a PDF in Active Server Pages:

Here’s the paraphrased section of the article, with the relevant code snippet updated and proper URL paths resolved:

```cs
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Web;
using System.Web.UI;
using System.Web.UI.WebControls;
using IronPdf;

// Namespace for the ASPX to PDF conversion tutorial
namespace AspxToPdfTutorial
{
    public partial class Invoice : System.Web.UI.Page
    {
        // Load event for the ASPX page
        protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // Instructs the IronPdf library to convert this web page to a PDF and display it within the browser
            IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.InBrowser);
        }
    }
}
```

This code snippet employs IronPDF to transform the current ASPX web page into a PDF, displaying it directly in a user's web browser when the page loads. This is particularly effective for seamlessly transforming web content into portable documents without requiring the user to invoke any special commands or take additional actions.

            var pdfOptions = new IronPdf.ChromePdfRenderOptions()
            {
                // Configure the header
                TextHeader = new IronPdf.TextHeaderFooter()
                {
                    CenterText = "Invoice",
                    DrawDividerLine = false,
                    Font = FontTypes.Arial,
                    FontSize = 12
                },
                // Configure the footer
                TextFooter = new IronPdf.TextHeaderFooter()
                {
                    LeftText = "{date} - {time}",
                    RightText = "Page {page} of {total-pages}",
                    Font = IronSoftware.Drawing.FontTypes.Arial,
                    FontSize = 12,
                },
            };
            // Convert the ASPX page to a PDF with the options applied
            IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.Attachment, "Invoice.pdf", pdfOptions);
        }
    }
}
```

This example shows how you can seamlessly add both headers and footers. The headers and footers can dynamically display document-related data, such as the current date, time, and page numbers. These elements are created using the `TextHeaderFooter` class, facilitating the easy inclusion of text with basic formatting in Arial font.

using System.Linq;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace AspxToPdfTutorial
{
    public partial class Invoice : System.Web.UI.Page
    {
        protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // Configure options for PDF rendering
            var pdfOptions = new IronPdf.ChromePdfRenderOptions()
            {
                TextHeader = new IronPdf.TextHeaderFooter()
                {
                    CenterText = "Invoice", // Centered header text
                    DrawDividerLine = false, // No divider line
                    Font = FontTypes.Arial, // Arial font
                    FontSize = 12 // Font size 12
                },
                TextFooter = new IronPdf.TextHeaderFooter()
                {
                    LeftText = "{date} - {time}", // Display date and time on the left

            // Render the current web page as a PDF with the specified options

This revised code includes inline comments to clarify each step and setting involved in the process, helping maintain clarity and readability in the implementation of the ASPX to PDF conversion using IronPDF.

As an alternative, headers and footers within the PDF can be crafted using the `HtmlHeaderFooter` class, which accommodates CSS, images, and hyperlinks to enrich the document's presentation.

```cs
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Web;
using System.Web.UI;
using System.Web.UI.WebControls;

namespace AspxToPdfTutorial
{
    public partial class Invoice : System.Web.UI.Page
    {
        protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // Configure PDF conversion options
            var pdfOptions = new IronPdf.ChromePdfRenderOptions()
            {
                MarginTop = 50, // Allocate enough space for the HTML header
                HtmlHeader = new IronPdf.HtmlHeaderFooter()
                {
                    HtmlFragment = "<div style='text-align: right;'><em style='color: pink;'>Page {page} of {total-pages}</em></div>"
                }
            };

            // Convert the ASPX page to a PDF file named "MyDocument.pdf"
            IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.Attachment, "MyDocument.pdf", pdfOptions);
        }
    }
}
```

As illustrated in our tutorials, dynamic text or HTML can be seamlessly integrated into the headers and footers of a PDF using placeholders. These placeholders allow for the insertion of specific types of content dynamically:

- `{page}`: Displays the current page number in the PDF.
- `{total-pages}`: Shows the total number of pages in the PDF document.
- `{url}`: Embeds the URL from which the PDF was generated.
- `{date}`: Inserts today's date, formatted according to the server's locale settings.
- `{time}`: Shows the current time in a 24-hour format.
- `{html-title}`: Adds the title from the `<head>` tag of the ASPX web form to the document.
- `{pdf-title}`: Specifies the name of the PDF file.

These placeholders ensure that each PDF can contain accurate and relevant data that updates automatically based on the content or context of the document.

## 5. Implementing Page Breaks in ASPX to PDF Conversion

In contrast to HTML, which typically extends into one continuous page, PDF files emulate the structure of physical paper by splitting content across multiple pages. To facilitate this behavior in your ASPX to PDF conversions, you can insert a specific piece of code into your ASPX file that instructs the PDF generator to introduce a page break at the desired point. This ensures that your converted documents maintain a neat and organized format, mimicking the layout of traditional printed media. Here’s how you can implement a page break in your .NET PDF:
```html
<div style='page-break-after: always;'>&nbsp;</div>
```

Here is the paraphrased section of the article. I've also resolved any relative URL paths to `ironpdf.com`.

```html
<div style='page-break-after: always;'>&nbsp;</div>
```

This code snippet adds a mandatory page break after the div element, ensuring that any content following this division will start on a new page when converted into a PDF document. This is particularly useful in standardizing how content is segmented in the generated PDF file.

## 6. Enhancing Performance with Async and Multithreading

IronPDF is compatible with .NET Framework versions 4.6.2 and later, as well as .NET Core 2 and subsequent releases. For these projects, the utilization of [ASYNC](https://ironpdf.com/how-to/async/) techniques enhances document processing speed, especially when handling numerous files concurrently.

By integrating Async operations with multithreaded CPUs and employing the `Parallel.ForEach` method, the efficiency in processing large volumes of PDFs can be substantially increased.
