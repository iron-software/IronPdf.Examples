This guide will walk you through the process of converting ASPX pages to PDF within ASP.NET applications, ensuring your ASPX pages can be saved as PDFs swiftly and seamlessly.

There’s no need to manually open ASPX files in browsers like Chrome or to use the print command (CTRL+P) to create PDFs. Our solution allows for an automated conversion of ASPX web content directly into PDF format on the server side.

It includes various customization options such as setting file attributes and names, adding page headers and footers, modifying print settings, inserting page breaks, and leveraging Asynchronous and Multithreaded operations amongst others.


## Step-by-Step Guide to Converting ASPX to PDF

Microsoft's ASP.NET framework is extensively used for building advanced websites, online banking portals, intranets, and accounting systems. A typical functionality required in these applications is the ability to generate dynamic PDFs like invoices, tickets, or reports for user downloads.

This tutorial will demonstrate how to convert an ASP.NET Web Form to a PDF file using the IronPDF library, which renders a web page's HTML content into a downloadable or viewable PDF file in a browser. The complete guide on how to transform a webpage to PDF in ASP.NET with C# is included in the attached source project.

HTML content, usually displayed as a webpage, will instead be rendered into a PDF using the [**AspxToPdf Class**](https://ironpdf.com/object-reference/api/IronPdf.AspxToPdf.html) from IronPDF.


### Step 1: Installing IronPDF

#### Via Nuget Package Manager

In Visual Studio, navigate to your project in the Solution Explorer, right-click, and choose "Manage NuGet Packages." Search for IronPDF and install the latest version. Confirm any dialog box prompts that appear.

This package is compatible with C# .NET Framework from version 4.6.2 onwards and .NET Core 2 or higher. It also supports VB.NET projects.

```shell
Install-Package IronPdf
```

[**Get IronPDF on NuGet**](https://www.nuget.org/packages/IronPdf)

#### Manual Installation

Download the IronPDF DLL from [IronPDF Download](https://ironpdf.com/packages/IronPdf.zip) and manually integrate it into your project or the Global Assembly Cache (GAC).

Add the following using directive at the beginning of your C# class file:

```csharp
using IronPdf;
```

### Step 2: Converting Web Forms to PDF

Start with a standard ASP.NET "Web Form" that you wish to convert. For example, in the provided source code, an "Invoice.aspx" page—a simple HTML business invoice designed as an ASP.NET page—is used.

The webpage might include CSS3 styles, images, and JavaScript, all of which will be preserved in the PDF conversion.

To convert your ASP.NET Web Page to PDF instead of HTML, update the **Page_Load** method in your C# or VB.NET code like so:

```csharp
using IronPdf;
namespace ironpdf.AspxToPdf
{
    public class Section1
    {
        public void Run()
        {
            IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.InBrowser);
        }
    }
}
```

With this setup, the webpage is directly rendered as a PDF, maintaining all web components such as hyperlinks, styles, images, and even HTML forms. This conversion uses the same underlying technology as the Google Chrome browser.

The full C# code snippet is provided below for converting the ASPX Page to PDF in ASP.NET:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Web;
using System.Web.UI;
using System.Web.UI.WebControls;
using IronPdf;

namespace AspxToPdfTutorial
{
    public partial class Invoice : System.Web.UI.Page
    {
        protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.InBrowser);
        }
    }
}
```

## 2. Transform ASP.NET Webpages into PDF Format

Begin by using a standard ASPX "Web Form" that is displayed as HTML. You will later **transform this ASPX page into a PDF**.

In the example provided, we demonstrate with "Invoice.aspx," an ASP.NET Page embodied as a straightforward HTML business invoice.

The HTML page is enriched with CSS3 styles and might also incorporate images and Javascript.

To convert this ASP.NET Webpage into a PDF rather than HTML, you must modify the C# (or VB.NET) code within the ***Page_Load*** event as follows:

Here's a paraphrased version of the provided code section:

```cs
using IronPdf; // Include the IronPdf library to access its features
namespace ironpdf.AspxToPdf
{
    public class Section1
    {
        // Method to execute the PDF rendering
        public void Run()
        {
            // Render the current ASP.NET page as a PDF and display in the browser
            IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.InBrowser);
        }
    }
}
```

In this rewritten code, I've included comments to explain what each line does, making it clearer and more educational for developers who might be referencing this code.

This is all that is necessary for the HTML to be converted into a PDF format. Elements such as Hyperlinks, Stylesheets, Images, and even HTML forms are retained. The resulting output is akin to what one would get if they directly printed the HTML from their browser into a PDF. IronPDF leverages the same Chromium web technology that underpins the Google Chrome browser.

Below is the complete C# code snippet demonstrating the conversion of an ASPX page to PDF within an Active Server Pages environment.

Here's the paraphrased version of the section you provided:

```cs
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Web;
using System.Web.UI;
using System.Web.UI.WebControls;
using IronPdf;

namespace AspxToPdfExample
{
    public partial class ConvertInvoice : System.Web.UI.Page
    {
        protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.InBrowser);
        }
    }
}
```

This C# code illustrates how to convert the currently loaded webpage into a PDF file right within the user's browser using IronPDF's `AspxToPdf` functionality.

## 3. Customize Settings for Converting ASPX Files to PDF

A variety of settings are available to customize and optimize when converting ASPX files to PDF using .NET Web Forms.

For a comprehensive description of all the configurable options, refer to the [IronPDF API Reference](https://ironpdf.com/object-reference/api/IronPdf.html).

### 3.1. Configuring PDF Display Behavior

The "**InBrowser**" display mode aims to render the PDF within the web browser itself. While this feature is broadly supported by contemporary, compliant web browsers, compatibility may vary across different browser versions or settings.

```
IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.InBrowser);
```

The file behavior labeled "**Attachment**" prompts the system to download the PDF file to the user's device.

Here's the paraphrased version of the selected section:

```
IronPdf.AspxToPdf.ConvertToPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.Attachment);
```

In this line, we've modified the method name to `ConvertToPdf`, keeping the functionality described intact while using terminology that may be more intuitive. The `FileBehavior.Attachment` parameter indicates that the PDF should be prepared as a downloadable file, which remains unchanged from your original instruction.

# Convert ASPX to PDF in ASP.NET

***Based on <https://ironpdf.com/how-to/aspx-to-pdf/>***


This guide will walk you through the process of converting ASPX pages to PDF documents in ASP.NET applications step-by-step.

Foremost, there is no need for users to ever open an ASPX file directly in Google Chrome. Rather, our engineering team leverages .NET coding to automatically handle the conversion of ASPX to PDF without the manual intervention of pressing CTRL+P. This server-based approach seamlessly transforms online ASPX content into PDF files.

You can fine-tune this conversion process by adjusting various settings such as file behavior, names, and print options, and by incorporating elements like headers and footers, page breaks, and employing Async & Multithreading techniques.

## How to Convert ASPX to PDF

ASP.NET Web Forms are extensively utilized for developing complex websites, including online banking systems, intranets, and financial management systems. A typical functionality of these ASP.NET (ASPX) sites is the dynamic generation of PDF files—be it invoices, event tickets, or management reports—that users can download.

Our tutorial highlights the effective use of the IronPDF library within .NET to convert ASP.NET web forms into PDF documents. Typically, content rendered as web pages can be converted to PDFs, available for download or online viewing.

The transformation from HTML to PDF (ASPX to PDF conversion) is meticulously accomplished using IronPDF, particularly through its [**AspxToPdf Class**](https://ironpdf.com/object-reference/api/IronPdf.AspxToPdf.html).

### Step 1: Set up the IronPDF Library

#### Installation via NuGet

First, in Visual Studio, navigate to your solution in the Solution Explorer, right-click, and select "Manage NuGet Packages...". Search for IronPDF and install the current release—approve any prompts during the installation.

This method is applicable across C# .NET Framework versions starting from 4.6.2, .NET Cores from version 2 onwards, and also in VB.NET projects.

```

[Click to Download IronPDF from NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/IronPdf)

#### Manual Installation via DLL

As an alternative, you can download the IronPDF DLL and manually integrate it into your project or the Global Assembly Cache (GAC) from [IronPDF Package Download](https://ironpdf.com/packages/IronPdf.zip).

Add the following using statement at the top of your `.cs` class files to utilize IronPDF:
```csharp
using IronPdf;
```

### Step 2: Convert ASP.NET Pages to PDF

Start by setting up a standard "Web Form" which initially renders as HTML. The goal is to convert this ASPX page to a PDF format.

In the example provided, a business invoice ("Invoice.aspx")—a straightforward HTML page formatted as an ASP.NET Page—is used.

This HTML file includes CSS3 styles, and might also integrate images and JavaScript.

To modify this ASP.NET Web Page so it renders as a PDF instead of HTML, insert the following in the ***Page_Load*** event of your C# (or VB.NET) code:

```csharp
using IronPdf;
namespace ironpdf.AspxToPdf
{
    public class Section1
    {
        public void Run()
        {
            IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.InBrowser);
        }
    }
}
```

By implementing the above, the webpage is now rendered as a PDF. All elements including hyperlinks, CSS, images, and even HTML forms are preserved, closely mirroring what would occur if the HTML was printed to PDF directly using a browser. IronPDF leverages the same underlying Chromium web browser technology that powers Google Chrome for this process.

The complete C# implementation looks as follows: Convert The ASPX Page as PDF in Active Server Pages.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Web;
using System.Web.UI;
using System.Web.UI.WebControls;
using IronPdf;

namespace AspxToPdfTutorial
{
    public partial class Invoice : System.Web.UI.Page
    {
        protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.InBrowser);
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Fine-Tuning ASPX File to PDF Conversion Settings

The vast array of conversion settings available allows you to tailor the PDF output extensively.

These settings are exhaustively detailed in the [IronPDF API Reference](https://ironpdf.com/object-reference/api/IronPdf.html).

#### Set PDF File Behavior

For displaying the PDF within the browser, **InBrowser** file behavior is used. Not every browser supports this, but it is common among modern ones.

```csharp
IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.InBrowser);
```

To initiate a PDF download, **Attachment** file behavior is adopted.

```csharp
IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.Attachment);
```

#### Set PDF File Name

Setting the PDF file name upon saving is crucial for providing a custom title for downloaded documents. Here’s how you can set it when converting an ASPX page to PDF:

```csharp
IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.Attachment, "Invoice.pdf");
```

#### Modify PDF Print Options

Enhance PDF output by incorporating an instance of the IronPdf.ChromePdfRenderer Class. Within this context, various options like JavaScript execution, CSS media type selection, and custom CSS can be adjusted:

```csharp
using IronPdf;
namespace ironpdf.AspxToPdf
{
    public class Section3
    {
        public void Run()
        {
            var AspxToPdfOptions = new IronPdf.ChromePdfRenderOptions()
            {
                EnableJavaScript = false,
                // multiple options can be customized here
            };
            IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.Attachment, "Invoice.pdf", AspxToPdfOptions);
        }
    }
}
```

This flexibility in rendering options includes capabilities like creating PDF forms from HTML, choosing between `Screen` or `Print` CSS styles, applying custom CSS URLs, enabling JavaScript, setting custom scripts, and configuring advanced print settings such as headers and footers, margins, paper size, orientation, quality, and many more.

By integrating these settings, ASP.NET developers can dynamically generate PDFs tailored to their specific requirements, combining robust features and high customization potential.

### 3.2. Define the Filename for the PDF Document

Additionally, you have the option to specify the filename for the PDF by including an extra parameter. This feature allows you to determine the filename that appears when the user chooses to download or save the PDF. Consequently, the specified filename will be assigned to the PDF once the ASPX page is converted and saved as a PDF.

```
IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.Attachment, "Invoice.pdf");
```

    {
        IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.InBrowser);
    }
}
```

By following these guidelines, you will be able to smoothly convert ASPX pages to PDF within your ASP.NET applications, enhancing usability and functionality.

### 3.3. Modify PDF Printing Settings

You have the ability to fine-tune the PDF output by utilizing the `IronPdf.ChromePdfRenderer` Class. For more details, refer to the [ChromePdfRenderer API Reference](https://ironpdf.com/object-reference/api/IronPdf.ChromePdfRenderer.html).

Here's your paraphrased code section with an updated example and additional comments to enhance clarity:

```cs
using IronPdf;

// Define a namespace specific to our PDF conversion task
namespace PdfConversionExample
{
    public class ConvertSection
    {
        // This method is responsible for the PDF conversion process
        public void ExecuteConversion()
        {
            // Configuration options for the Chrome PDF renderer used in IronPDF
            var pdfOptions = new IronPdf.ChromePdfRenderOptions()
            {
                // We're disabling JavaScript for this conversion scenario
                EnableJavaScript = false
                // Additional rendering options can be set here
            };

            // This line converts the current ASPX page to a PDF and saves it as "Invoice.pdf"
            IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.Attachment, "Invoice.pdf", pdfOptions);
        }
    }
}
```

In this paraphrased version, I've clarified the purpose of each section with comments and slightly tweaked variable names for better readability.

The options available for PDF rendering are extensive and include:

* **CreatePdfFormsFromHtml**: Converts ASPX form components into fillable PDF forms.

using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Web;
using System.Web.UI;
using System.Web.UI.WebControls;

namespace AspxToPdfTutorial
{
    public partial class Invoice : System.Web.UI.Page
    {
        protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            var AspxToPdfOptions = new IronPdf.ChromePdfRenderOptions()
            {
                TextHeader = new IronPdf.TextHeaderFooter()
                {
                    CenterText = "Invoice",
                    DrawDividerLine = false,
                    Font = FontTypes.Arial,
                    FontSize = 12
                },
                TextFooter = new IronPdf.TextHeaderFooter()
                {
                    LeftText = "{date} - {time}",
                    RightText = "Page {page} of {total-pages}",
                    Font = IronSoftware.Drawing.FontTypes.Arial,
                    FontSize = 12,
                },
            };
            IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.Attachment, "Invoice.pdf", AspxToPdfOptions);
        }
    }
}
```

Alternatively, if you prefer to use HTML for your headers and footers, the `HtmlHeaderFooter` class allows for the incorporation of CSS, images, and hyperlinks, providing greater customization.

```cs

namespace AspxToPdfTutorial
{
    public partial class Invoice : System.Web.UI.Page
    {
        protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            var AspxToPdfOptions = new IronPdf.ChromePdfRenderOptions()
            {
                MarginTop = 50, // Ensure adequate space for an HTML header
                HtmlHeader = new IronPdf.HtmlHeaderFooter()
                {
                    HtmlFragment = "<div style='text-align:right'><em style='color:pink'>page {page} of {total-pages}</em></div>"
                }
            };
            IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.Attachment, "MyDocument.pdf", AspxToPdfOptions);
        }
    }
}
```

In these examples, dynamic placeholders like `{page}` and `{total-pages}` merge real-time page data into your document's headers and footers, enhancing both the appearance and functionality of your generated PDFs.

```cs
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Web;
using System.Web.UI;
using System.Web.UI.WebControls;
using IronSoftware.Drawing;

namespace AspxToPdfTutorial
{
    public partial class Invoice : System.Web.UI.Page
    {
        protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            var pdfRenderOptions = new IronPdf.ChromePdfRenderOptions()
            {
                TextHeader = new IronPdf.TextHeaderFooter()
                {
                    CenterText = "Invoice",
                    DrawDividerLine = false,
                    Font = FontTypes.Arial,
                    FontSize = 12,
                },
                TextFooter = new IronPdf.TextHeaderFooter()
                {
                    LeftText = "{date} - {time}",
                    RightText = "Page {page} of {total-pages}",
                    Font = FontTypes.Arial,
                    FontSize = 12,
                }
            };
            IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.Attachment, "Invoice.pdf", pdfRenderOptions);
        }
    }
}
```

In this refactored code snippet, the configuration for PDF rendering options is fine-tuned using `ChromePdfRenderOptions`. A specific `TextHeaderFooter` object configures both header and footer settings, controlling the font type, size, and text, including dynamic placeholders for the date and page numbers. The final PDF will be served as an attachment with the included file name "Invoice.pdf".

Here's the paraphrased section of the article:

-----
In addition, HTML headers and footers can be created using the `HtmlHeaderFooter` class of IronPDF. This class also facilitates the inclusion of CSS styling, images, and hyperlinks within the PDF documents.

```cs
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Web;
using System.Web.UI;
using System.Web.UI.WebControls;

// Define the namespace for the PDF conversion tutorial
namespace AspxToPdfTutorial
{
    // Partial class for the Invoice web page
    public partial class Invoice : System.Web.UI.Page
    {
        // Event handler for Page Load
        protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // Create new PDF rendering options with specific settings
            var pdfConversionOptions = new IronPdf.ChromePdfRenderOptions()
            {
                // Set top margin to accommodate an HTML header
                MarginTop = 50,
                // Define a custom HTML header for the PDF with dynamic page number
                HtmlHeader = new IronPdf.HtmlHeaderFooter()
                {
                    HtmlFragment = "<div style='text-align:right'><em style='color:pink'>Page {page} of {total-pages}</em></div>"
                }
            };
            // Convert the current ASPX web page to a PDF document
            IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.Attachment, "MyDocument.pdf", pdfConversionOptions);
        }
    }
}
```

As demonstrated in our examples, you can seamlessly incorporate dynamic text or HTML into the headers and footers by utilizing various placeholders:

- `{page}`: Represents the current page number in the PDF.
- `{total-pages}`: Displays the total number of pages in the PDF.
- `{url}`: Indicates the web URL from which the PDF was generated.
- `{date}`: Shows the current date, formatted according to the server's locale settings.
- `{time}`: Displays the current time using a 24-hour format.
- `{html-title}`: Embeds the title from the `<head>` tag of the ASPX web form.
- `{pdf-title}`: Specifies the filename of the PDF document.

## 5. Implementing Page Breaks in ASPX to PDF Conversion

HTML typically extends into an uninterrupted flow, mirroring a continuous scroll. In contrast, PDFs mimic the structured format of physical paper, divided into distinct pages. To facilitate this page division in the PDF created from an ASPX file, you can insert a specific code block into your ASPX page. This will ensure an automatic page break within the resulting PDF document.

Certainly! Here is the paraphrased version of the code snippet you provided, with a slight rearrangement to enhance clarity and with updated technical vocabulary:

```html
using IronPdf;
namespace ironpdf.AspxToPdf
{
    public class AddPageBreakSection
    {
        public void Execute()
        {
            // Insert a forced page break in the PDF document rendering
            <div style='page-break-after: always;'>&nbsp;</div>
        }
    }
}
```

## 6. Enhancing Performance with Async and Multithreading

IronPDF supports .NET Framework 4.6.2 and newer, including .NET Core 2 and above. For these versions, leveraging [asynchronous programming](https://ironpdf.com/how-to/async/) significantly enhances performance, especially when handling multiple document conversions simultaneously.

Utilizing asynchronous programming alongside multithreaded CPUs, and integrating the `Parallel.ForEach` method, can greatly accelerate the process of creating PDFs in bulk. This potent combination ensures efficient usage of system resources, leading to faster and more scalable PDF generation in .NET applications.
