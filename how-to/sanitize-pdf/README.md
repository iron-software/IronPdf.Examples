# How to Perform PDF Sanitization

Sanitizing PDF documents is essential for several reasons. First and foremost, it increases document security by eliminating elements that could be harmful, such as embedded scripts and metadata. This proactive step significantly decreases the likelihood of malicious exploitation. Furthermore, it makes PDFs more compatible across various platforms by stripping away complex or proprietary features, thereby enhancing usability. Protecting against data leakage and maintaining document integrity, PDF sanitization is a vital practice in securing and trusting document handling procedures.

## Example of PDF Sanitization

The essence of sanitizing a PDF lies in converting the original PDF into an image format, which strips out elements like JavaScript code, embedded objects, and interactive buttons. This image format is then reconverted into a PDF. We offer both Bitmap and SVG options for this process. Here are some distinctions between using SVG instead of Bitmap:
- SVG is faster in processing.
- It yields a PDF that remains searchable.
- The layout might vary slightly with SVG.

```cs
using IronPdf;

// Load the PDF document
PdfDocument originalPdf = PdfDocument.FromFile("sample.pdf");

// Sanitizing the PDF by converting to Bitmap
PdfDocument bitmapSanitizedPdf = Cleaner.SanitizeWithBitmap(originalPdf);

// Sanitizing the PDF by converting to SVG
PdfDocument svgSanitizedPdf = Cleaner.SanitizeWithSvg(originalPdf);

// Saving the sanitized PDFs
bitmapSanitizedPdf.SaveAs("bitmapSanitized.pdf");
svgSanitizedPdf.SaveAs("svgSanitized.pdf");
```

## Scanning PDFs for Vulnerabilities

To scan a PDF for potential vulnerabilities, you can use the `ScanPdf` method from the `Cleaner` class. This method utilizes a default YARA file to assess the PDF, but you can also supply a custom YARA file as a second parameter if it better meets your specific needs.

YARA files are crucial in identifying and defining rules or patterns that pinpoint characteristics typical of malicious PDF files. These rules support security analysts in automating threat detection and in implementing risk mitigation strategies.

```cs
using IronPdf;
using System;

// Load the PDF document
PdfDocument pdfDocument = PdfDocument.FromFile("sample.pdf");

// Execute PDF scan
CleanerScanResult scanResults = Cleaner.ScanPdf(pdfDocument);

// Displaying the scan results
Console.WriteLine(scanResults.IsDetected);
Console.WriteLine(scanResults.Risks.Count);
```

By implementing these methods, you enhance not only the security but also the functionality and reliability of your PDF documents.
