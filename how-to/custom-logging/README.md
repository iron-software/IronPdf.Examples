# How to Implement Custom Logging in C#

***Based on <https://ironpdf.com/how-to/custom-logging/>***


Custom logging offers a personalized approach to how applications log information. It allows for the development of log files that chronicle various details, including events and messages that the software issues during its execution.

## Implementing Custom Logging

To begin using custom logging, first set the `LoggingMode` property to `LoggingModes.Custom`. Then, associate the `CustomLogger` property with the custom logger class you've designed.

```cs
using IronPdf;

namespace ironpdf.CustomLogging
{
    public class LoggerDemo
    {
        public void SetupLogger()
        {
            IronSoftware.Logger.LoggingMode = IronSoftware.Logger.LoggingModes.Custom;
            IronSoftware.Logger.CustomLogger = new CustomLogManager("EventLogging");
        }
    }
}
```

By configuring these settings, IronPdf will stream its log outputs to your custom logging handler. The outputs will mirror those generated by the standard IronPdf logger, with the difference being that they're now being handled according to your custom logger's specifications. Consider this example of a custom logger.

```cs
using IronPdf;

namespace ironpdf.CustomLogging
{
    public class LoggerDemo
    {
        public class CustomLogManager : ILogger
        {
            private readonly string logCategory;
        
            public CustomLogManager(string logCategory)
            {
                this.logCategory = logCategory;
            }
        
            public IDisposable BeginScope<TState>(TState state)
            {
                return null;  // Implement scope management as necessary.
            }
        
            public bool IsEnabled(LogLevel level)
            {
                return true;  // Or implement actual logic to determine if a log level is enabled.
            }
        
            public void Log<TState>(LogLevel level, EventId id, TState state, Exception error, Func<TState, Exception, string> formatter)
            {
                if (!IsEnabled(level))
                {
                    return;  
                }
                
                // Custom logic for handling logs.
                string message = formatter(state, error);
                
                // Utilize 'level', 'id', 'logCategory', and 'message' to customize logging output.
                // For instance, write to a database, a file, or the console.
                
                // Example: Output to console
                Console.WriteLine($"[{level}] [{logCategory}] - {message}");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the log entries are enhanced with supplementary details such as log level and category.

By creating a custom logger tailored to your specific needs, you gain more control and flexibility over how logging is handled within your applications.
