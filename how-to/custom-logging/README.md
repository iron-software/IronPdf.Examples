# Using Custom Logging in C&#35;

***Based on <https://ironpdf.com/how-to/custom-logging/>***


Custom logging is the process of designing a logging system that fits the specific needs and requirements of an application. It includes creating log files that record information, events, and messages produced by software during its execution.

### Getting Started with IronPDF

## Example of Custom Logging

To enable custom logging, set the `LoggingMode` property to `LoggingModes.Custom`. Then, assign a custom logger class that you've designed to the `CustomLogger` property.

```cs
IronSoftware.Logger.LoggingMode = IronSoftware.Logger.LoggingModes.Custom;
IronSoftware.Logger.CustomLogger = new CustomLoggerClass("AppLogging");
```

By doing this, IronPdf logs will be funneled into your custom logger object. The contents of the logs will be the same as those generated by the default IronPdf logger, but they will now be routed through your custom logger. The handling of these messages will depend on how the custom logger is programmed. Below is an example of such a custom logger class.

```cs
public class CustomLoggerClass : ILogger
{
    private readonly string _categoryName;

    public CustomLoggerClass(string categoryName)
    {
        this._categoryName = categoryName;
    }

    public IDisposable BeginScope<TState>(TState state)
    {
        // Scope management might be implemented here if required.
        return null;
    }

    public bool IsEnabled(LogLevel logLevel)
    {
        // Logic to determine the enablement of logging at various levels
        return true;
    }

    public void Log<TState>(LogLevel logLevel, EventId eventId, TState state, Exception exception, Func<TState, Exception, string> formatter)
    {
        if (!IsEnabled(logLevel))
        {
            // No action taken if the log level is disabled.
            return;
        }

        // Creating the log message using a customizable formatter.
        string logMessage = formatter(state, exception);

        // The log behavior can be further customized here. For example storing to databases, files etc.
        // Example of console output.
        Console.WriteLine($"[{logLevel}] [{_categoryName}] - {logMessage}");
    }
}
```
