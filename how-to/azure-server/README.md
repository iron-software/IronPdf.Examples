IronPDF is now capable of operating as a remote service, providing elevated levels of convenience, efficiency, and deployability for its users. This solution is already popular among those who deploy [IronPDF inside a Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/ironsoftwareofficial/ironpdfengine) to work seamlessly with their main applications.

The [`IronPdf.Server.Azure`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/IronPdf.Server.Azure) NuGet package facilitates the deployment of IronPDF on the cloud, simplifying its usage across numerous platforms, including mobile environments!

## Set Up Azure App Service

1. Set up a new Azure BLOB Storage Container.
2. Establish a new Azure App Service and a corresponding App Service Plan. We recommend choosing the Basic B2 plan or higher; however, the Free F1 plan might be adequate for initial experiments.
3. In the configuration section of your App Service, adjust these settings:
   - `BLOB_STORAGE_CONNECTION`: Configure this connection string following Microsoftâ€™s specified format.
   - `BLOB_STORAGE_CONTAINER`: Name your storage container.
   - `HTTP20_ONLY_PORT`: This should be configured to 80.
4. Open the provided Azure App Service Linux Container project, `IronPdf.Android.Server.csproj`, in Visual Studio.
5. Generate a new publish profile targeting the Azure App Service you prepared earlier.
6. Execute the publish command.
7. Within a few minutes, you can confirm your application's deployment by accessing the provided URL with a browser, which will display a basic debug message.

## Configure Android MAUI Client

1. Launch the example MAUI Android application, `IronPdf.Android.Client.csproj`, using Visual Studio.
2. In the`MainPage.xaml.cs` file, input your license key or opt to leave it empty to produce watermarked outputs.
3. Update the `Host = "https://YOUR-APP-SERVICE.azurewebsites.net/"` line in `MainPage.xaml.cs` to point to your Azure App Service hosting the IronPdf.
4. Run the demo on an Android device that supports API level 21.0 or above.

**Note**: The initial rendering might take extra time if it's the first activation of your Azure App Service after setting it up.
