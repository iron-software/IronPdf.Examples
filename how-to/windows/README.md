# IronPDF Compatibility with Windows Platforms for .NET Usage

***Based on <https://ironpdf.com/how-to/windows/>***


IronPDF fully supports Windows 10, 11, and Windows Server operating environments for various .NET versions including .NET 8, 7, 6, Core, Standard, and Framework.

## Support for Windows Server

For **Windows Server 2022 and 2016** versions, IronPDF extends compatibility both for installations with a graphical user interface ("Desktop Experience") and for command-line only environments ("Core"). However, compatibility with **Windows Server 2019 and 2012** is available strictly for the Desktop Experience setup.

**Coverage for Windows Server 2022 & 2016:**

- <i class="fa-regular fa-circle-check" style="color: #63E6BE;"></i> Both UI and Core installations for Windows Server 2022 & 2016.

**Coverage for Windows Server 2019 & 2012:**

- <i class="fa-regular fa-circle-check" style="color: #63E6BE;"></i> UI ("Desktop experience") for Windows Server 2019 & 2012
- <i class="fa-regular fa-circle-xmark" style="color: #ff4abd;"></i> Core installations for Windows Server 2019 & 2012 not supported.

Our efforts to support Core and Nano editions of Windows Server are in progress. The challenge mainly lies in the dependencies on certain media/graphics DLLs that the Chromium engine requires. These are typically absent in the more minimalistic Core versions.

On a related note, once support for Windows Server Core is solidified, IronPDF will also aim to extend support to Windows Nano Server, a more condensed form of Windows Server Core.

### Windows Server Standard & DataCenter Variants

As per Microsoft's "[Comparison of Standard and Datacenter editions of Windows Server 2016](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/get-started/editions-comparison-windows-server-2016?tabs=full-comparison)", Windows Server DataCenter builds upon the Standard edition by adding enhanced storage capabilities. IronPDF functions seamlessly on Windows Server DataCenter with Desktop Experience.

## Specific Installation for Windows 

The primary IronPDF NuGet package leverages the [IronPDF.Native.Chrome.Windows Package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/IronPdf.Native.Chrome.Windows/), which supports the Chrome browser binaries needed for both x86 and x64 Windows architectures.

- The core [IronPDF NuGet Package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/IronPdf/) is compatible with both x86 and x64 configurations.

Should there be a need to target a specific system architecture, it is possible to remove the irrelevant `/runtimes` directory (either x86 or x64).

## Recommended Hardware Specifications

Since IronPDF utilizes the Chromium engine to convert HTML to PDFs with high fidelity, resembling Google Chromeâ€™s printing functionality, the specifications needed are mostly to accommodate Chromium's operational requirements.

- Minimum Specifications: 1 Core & 1.75 GB of RAM
- Recommended Specifications: 2 Cores & 8 GB of RAM or higher
