## Conversion Process: From Web Forms to PDFs

Beginning with a standard ASPX web form that renders HTML, we will convert this page to a PDF file format. In our example, we utilize "Invoice.aspx"—a simple business invoice represented as an ASP.NET web page.

The webpage includes CSS3 styles, possibly images, and JavaScript. To convert this to a PDF rather than HTML in the browser, the following line should be added to the `Page_Load` event in your C# (or VB.NET) code:

```cs
IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.InBrowser);
```

The HTML content is now transformed into a PDF, effectively replicating the user's experience of printing the page to PDF directly from their browser. IronPDF leverages Chromium to maintain high fidelity of web assets like hyperlinks, stylesheets, images, and forms in the PDF output.

Below is the complete code snippet, illustrating the use of IronPDF within as ASP.NET:
```cs
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Web;
using System.Web.UI;
using System.Web.UI.WebControls;
using IronPdf;

namespace AspxToPdfTutorial
{
    public partial class Invoice : System.Web.UI.Page
    {
    protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.InBrowser);
    }
}
}
```

<hr class="separator">

<hr class="separator">

<h4 class="tutorial-segment-title">How to Tutorials</h4>

```cs
IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.InBrowser);
```

This single line of code transforms the HTML content into a PDF, preserving elements such as hyperlinks, styles from CSS, images, and even HTML forms. The process mirrors what users typically achieve by printing the HTML page as a PDF directly from their browser. IronPDF utilizes the powerful Chromium web browser engine to ensure the content is accurately rendered.

Here’s the complete C# code segment that demonstrates how to convert the ASPX page to a PDF within the context of an Active Server Pages environment:

```cs
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Web;
using System.Web.UI;
using System.Web.UI.WebControls;
using IronPdf;

namespace AspxToPdfTutorial
{
    public partial class Invoice : System.Web.UI.Page
    {
        protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.InBrowser);
        }
    }
}
```

Here's the paraphrased section with the relative URL resolved to ironpdf.com:

```cs
// Converts the current ASPX page into a PDF that will open in the user's browser
IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.InBrowser);

```

# Converting ASPX to PDF in .NET Applications

In this tutorial, we will explore how to transform ASPX web pages into PDF documents using ASP.NET. This capability is crucial for websites built with ASP.NET for scenarios like online banking, intranets, and accounting systems where dynamic PDF generation (e.g., for invoices or reports) is needed.

We'll utilize IronPDF to achieve this conversion, allowing us to transform any ASP.NET web form into a downloadable or viewable PDF file. Typically, these pages are rendered as HTML, but with IronPDF, we'll instead render them as PDFs.

Let's dive into how this is accomplished using the IronPDF's `AspxToPdf` tools.

## Getting Started: Setting Up IronPDF

### Installation via NuGet Package Manager

First, install IronPDF in your .NET project using Visual Studio. Right-click on your project in Solution Explorer, select "Manage NuGet Packages...", and search for IronPDF. Install the latest version by following the prompts:

```

## Converting Web Pages to PDF

Begin by using a standard ASPX web form. Through the source code provided, we examine a business invoice example implemented as an ASP.NET page, complete with CSS, images, and JavaScript.

To convert the HTML content to PDF, modify the `Page_Load` function in your C# code:
```csharp
protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.InBrowser);
}
```

This method ensures that the resulting PDF retains styles, hyperlinks, and even forms, almost as if you had printed the page from a browser yourself. Thanks to the Chromium technology that IronPDF leverages, similar to the Google Chrome browser, the conversion is seamless and robust.

## Enhancing PDFs with Headers, Footers, and Settings

IronPDF offers a variety of options to customize the PDF output via the `AspxToPdf` class:
- Determine how the PDF opens with `FileBehavior` settings like `InBrowser` or `Attachment`.
- Set custom file names.
- Render options include disabling JavaScript, setting custom margins, selecting page size and orientation, and more.

Adjust these settings by creating an instance of `ChromePdfRenderOptions`:
```csharp
var pdfOptions = new IronPdf.ChromePdfRenderOptions()
{
    Header = new SimpleHeaderFooter()
    {
        CenterText = "Invoice",
        FontSize = 14,
        DrawDividerLine = true
    },
    Footer = new SimpleHeaderFooter()
    {
        LeftText = "{date} - {time}",
        RightText = "Page {page} of {total-pages}",
        FontSize = 14
    }
};
IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.Attachment, "Invoice.pdf", pdfOptions);
}

Additionally, explore more complex implementations like using HTML content in headers and footers, adding page breaks, enabling asynchronous processing, and improving performance with multithreading techniques. 

Download and experiment with the full [ASPX to PDF tutorial source code](https://ironpdf.com/downloads/Aspx-To-Pdf-Tutorial.zip) to better understand how to integrate these features into your projects. 

Ultimately, experimenting within your own ASP.NET projects will be the best way to master these techniques and fully leverage the PDF conversion capabilities of IronPDF.

### 3.3. Adjusting PDF Output Settings

To tailor the output of your PDF file, you can utilize an instance of the `IronPdf.ChromePdfRenderer` class.

Explore more about the class and its capabilities at:
[https://ironpdf.com/object-reference/api/IronPdf.ChromePdfRenderer.html](https://ironpdf.com/object-reference/api/IronPdf.ChromePdfRenderer.html)

Here is a paraphrased version of the given C# code snippet:

```cs
// Create an instance of ChromePdfRenderOptions for custom PDF settings
var pdfOptions = new IronPdf.ChromePdfRenderOptions()
{
    EnableJavaScript = false, // JavaScript execution in PDF is disabled
    // Additional options can be configured as needed
};

// Render the current ASPX page as a PDF with specific options and save as "Invoice.pdf"
IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.Attachment, "Invoice.pdf", pdfOptions);
```

Here is a paraphrased section of the article:

The array of options for PDF rendering includes:

- **ApplyMarginToHeaderAndFooter**: This setting applies margins to HTML headers and footers, where the default setting is false, meaning headers and footers have zero margin. This setting only supports ChromeRender.
- **CreatePdfFormsFromHtml**: Converts ASPX form components into editable forms within the PDF.
- **CssMediaType**: Enables the application of CSS styles and CSS3 style sheets for media types such as "screen" or "print".
- **CustomCssUrl**: Permits the application of a custom CSS style-sheet via a URL to the HTML content.
- **EnableJavaScript**: Activates JavaScript, jQuery, and Json code execution within the ASPX page. It may require a designated RenderDelay.
- **FirstPageNumber**: Establishes the starting page number for headers and footers. Typically set to 1 by default.
- **FitToPaperWidth**: Attempts to fit the PDF content within the constraints of one page's width.
- **GenerateUniqueDocumentIdentifiers**: Deactivates file equality checking based on binary comparison, commonly used in unit testing.
- **GrayScale**: Generates a PDF in grayscale, displaying shades of gray rather than full color.
- **HtmlHeader**: Defines custom header content for each PDF page, which can include text or HTML.
- **TextHeader** & **TextFooter**: Assigns text-based headers and footers for each PDF page. They support dynamic content merging like 'mail-merge' and can automatically convert URLs into hyperlinks.
- **HtmlFooter**: Assigns custom footer content for each PDF page using either simple text or HTML.
- **InputEncoding**: Sets the character encoding for input data as a string. Default setting for ASP.NET is UTF-8.
- **MarginBottom**, **MarginLeft**, **MarginRight**, **MarginTop**: Controls the PDF margins in millimeters at the bottom, left, right, and top of the page. A setting of zero denotes a borderless PDF.
- **PaperOrientation**: Sets the orientation of the PDF document to either landscape or portrait.
- **PaperSize**: Sets the intended paper size for PDFs, using `System.Drawing.Printing.PaperKind` or custom dimensions set through the `SetCustomPaperSize(int width, int height)` method.
- **PrintHtmlBackgrounds**: Enables printing of HTML backgrounds in the PDF.
- **RenderDelay**: Sets a delay in milliseconds to allow JavaScript or Json scripts to execute before the PDF is printed.
- **Timeout**: Specifies the maximum allowed time in seconds for rendering a PDF.
- **Title**: Sets the title metadata of the PDF document.
- **ViewPortHeight** and **ViewPortWidth**: Determine the virtual screen height and width, respectively, used for rendering HTML to PDF in IronPdf, measured in pixels.

### 4.1. Example of Adding Headers and Footers to ASPX PDFs

Using IronPDF, it is straightforward to embellish your PDF files with headers and footers. Below, you'll find an example demonstrating how to insert dynamic and static elements into the headers and footers of your generated PDF documents.

```cs
using IronSoftware.Drawing;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Web;
using System.Web.UI;
using System.Web.UI.WebControls;

namespace AspxToPdfTutorial
{
    public partial class Invoice : System.Web.UI.Page
    {
        protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            var pdfOptions = new IronPdf.ChromePdfRenderOptions()
            {
                TextHeader = new IronPdf.TextHeaderFooter()
                {
                    CenterText = "Invoice",
                    DrawDividerLine = false,
                    Font = FontTypes.Arial,
                    FontSize = 12
                },
                TextFooter = new IronPdf.TextHeaderFooter()
                {
                    LeftText = "{date} - {time}",
                    RightText = "Page {page} of {total-pages}",
                    Font = IronSoftware.Drawing.FontTypes.Arial,
                    FontSize = 12
                },
            };
            IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.Attachment, "Invoice.pdf", pdfOptions);
        }
    }
}
```

For scenarios requiring more visually appealing components, you can use the `HtmlHeaderFooter` class, which accommodates CSS, images, and hyperlinks.

```cs
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Web;
using System.Web.UI;
using System.Web.UI.WebControls;

namespace AspxToPdfTutorial
{
    public partial class Invoice : System.Web.UI.Page
    {
        protected void Page_Load(sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            var pdfOptions = new IronPdf.ChromePdfRenderOptions()
            {
                MarginTop = 50, // Allocate enough space for the HTML header
                HtmlHeader = new IronPdf.HtmlHeaderFooter()
                {
                    HtmlFragment = "<div style='text-align:right'><em style='color:pink'>page {page} of {total-pages}</em></div>"
                }
            };
            IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.Attachment, "MyDocument.pdf", pdfOptions);
        }
    }
}
```

These examples showcase the capacity to merge dynamic texts or HTML tags into the headers and footers by using placeholders like `{page}`, `{total-pages}`, `{date}`, `{time}`, `{html-title}`, and `{pdf-title}`, maximizing both functionality and customization for your PDFs.

using System.Web.UI.WebControls;

namespace AspxToPdfTutorial
{
    public partial class Invoice : System.Web.UI.Page
    {
        protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            var pdfOptions = new IronPdf.ChromePdfRenderOptions()
            {
                MarginTop = 50, // Ensuring there is enough room for an HTML header
                HtmlHeader = new IronPdf.HtmlHeaderFooter()
                {
                    HtmlFragment = "<div style='text-align:right;'><em style='color:pink;'>Page {page} of {total-pages}</em></div>"
                }
            };
            IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.Attachment, "MyDocument.pdf", pdfOptions);
        }
    }
}
```

In this rewritten code segment:
- The `IronPdf.ChromePdfRenderOptions` instance is now named `pdfOptions` for simplicity.
- Comments and HTML in the `HtmlHeader` have been slightly adjusted for clarity and consistency.
- The structure and commands remain functionally consistent with the original, ensuring the same operational output.

In our examples, you can see how dynamic text or HTML can be integrated into PDF headers and footers by using placeholders:

- `{page}` to display the current PDF page number.
- `{total-pages}` to show the total number of pages in the PDF.
- `{date}` to append the current date, formatted according to the server's locale settings.
- `{time}` to include the current time formatted in a 24-hour format.
- `{html-title}` to insert the title from the ASPX web form's `<head>` tag.
- `{pdf-title}` to specify the name of the PDF document.

## 5. Implementing Page Breaks in ASPX File to PDF Conversion

HTML typically extends continuously into a lengthy document, while PDFs are structured into distinct, consistent pages reminiscent of actual paper. To enforce a page break within the PDF generated from an ASPX file, incorporate this snippet into your ASPX page code:

```html
<div style='page-break-after: always;'>&nbsp;</div>
```

This simple code ensures that the PDF rendering process will introduce a page break at the specified point, mimicking the paper-based page division in your PDF documents.

Sure, here’s the paraphrased content for the provided HTML code snippet:

```html
<div style="page-break-after: always;">&nbsp;</div>
```

This snippet is specifically designed to insert a page break in the generated PDF document when converting from an ASPX page in an ASP.NET application using IronPDF, ensuring that new content starts on a new page.

## 6. Enhance Performance Using Async and Multithreading

IronPDF supports .NET Framework 4.0, .NET Core 2.0, and higher versions. Projects that are built on Framework 4.5 or newer can leverage [ASYNC](https://ironpdf.com/how-to/async/) techniques to optimize performance when handling multiple documents simultaneously.

By incorporating Async programming alongside multithreaded CPUs and the `Parallel.ForEach` method, there is a notable increase in efficiency for large-scale PDF processing workflows.
