***Based on <https://ironpdf.com/tutorials/aspx-to-pdf/>***


### Introduction

This tutorial will take you through a step-by-step process of converting ASPX pages into PDF files in ASP.NET applications. It's common in many web applications, like those for online banking or internal management systems, to offer users downloadable PDFs of dynamic data, such as invoices or reports. IronPDF, a comprehensive library for .NET, simplifies this conversion from HTML to PDF.

### Overview

Using IronPDF's `AspxToPdf` class, you can easily transform any ASP.NET web page into a downloadable or viewable PDF file. This guide covers converting HTML, typically viewed in browsers, into well-formatted PDF documents.

### Initial Setup

#### Installing IronPDF

**Using NuGet**: In Visual Studio, right-click on the project in Solution Explorer, select "Manage NuGet Packages", then search for and install IronPDF. This will be compatible with C# .NET Framework projects from version 4 and newer, including .NET Core 2 and VB.NET projects.

```

[Direct NuGet Link](https://www.nuget.org/packages/IronPdf)

**Manual Installation**: If preferred, download and install the IronPDF DLL manually from [IronPDF Downloads](https://ironpdf.com/packages/IronPdf.zip).

Add the following using statement in your C# files:

```csharp
using IronPdf;
```

### Converting a Webpage to PDF

Begin by setting up a standard "Web Form" in ASPX that displays like HTML. In our example, "Invoice.aspx" acts as an HTML template for a business invoice. The webpage may incorporate CSS3, images, and JavaScript.

Here's how to reroute the page load to render as a PDF instead of HTML in the `Page_Load` event in C#:

```csharp
using IronPdf;
namespace ironpdf.AspxToPdf
{
    public class Section1
    {
        public void Run()
        {
            IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.InBrowser);
        }
    }
}
```

Here’s what the entire code looks like for converting an ASPX page to a PDF:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Web;
using System.Web.UI;
using System.Web.UI.WebControls;
using IronPdf;

namespace AspxToPdfTutorial
{
    public partial class Invoice : System.Web.UI.Page
    {
        protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.InBrowser);
        }
    }
}
```

When using IronPDF, the HTML content including links, images, and even forms are well-preserved just as if the user had used a browser's print-to-PDF feature. IronPDF leverages the underlying technology of the Chromium web browser, akin to that of Google Chrome, for high-fidelity PDF creation.

<hr class="separator">

<h4 class="tutorial-segment-title">How to Tutorials</h4>

## 2. Transforming ASP.NET Webpages into PDF Documents

Starting with a standard ASPX "Web Form" that outputs HTML, our goal is to **transform this ASPX page into a PDF document**.

In the provided example source code, we handle a business invoice named "Invoice.aspx," which is a straightforward HTML business invoice displayed as an ASP.NET page.

This HTML page is enriched with CSS3 stylesheets and might also incorporate images and JavaScript.

To convert this ASP.NET webpage into a PDF rather than HTML, it's necessary to adjust the C# (or VB.NET) code within the ***Page_Load*** event:
```

Here's the paraphrased section of the code with relative URL paths resolved:

```cs
using IronPdf;
namespace ironpdf.AspxToPdf
{
    public class PdfConversion
    {
        public void Execute()
        {
            IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.InBrowser);
        }
    }
}
```

This modification retains the original functionality while slightly altering structure and identifiers.

This conversion process ensures your HTML content retains its integrity in the PDF format, including hyperlinks, stylesheets, images, and HTML forms. The result is a PDF that closely mirrors what you would get by printing the HTML directly from your web browser. This functionally rich output is enabled by IronPDF, which leverages the same Chromium web browser technology found in Google Chrome.

Below, you'll find the complete C# code snippet for transforming an ASPX page into a PDF using IronPDF in an Active Server Pages environment.

Here's the paraphrased section of the code snippet from the article:

```cs
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Web;
using System.Web.UI;
using System.Web.UI.WebControls;
using IronPdf;

namespace AspxToPdfTutorial
{
    public partial class Invoice : System.Web.UI.Page
    {
        protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // Render the current web page as a PDF directly in the user's browser.
            IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.InBrowser);
        }
    }
}
```

## 3. Customize Settings for Converting ASPX to PDF

When transforming an ASPX file into a PDF using .NET Web Forms, numerous customization options are available to optimize the conversion process.

You can find a comprehensive list of these settings detailed in the online documentation at [IronPdf AspxToPdf API](https://ironpdf.com/object-reference/api/IronPdf.AspxToPdf.html).

### 3.1 Define PDF Viewing Behavior

The "**InBrowser**" setting strives to display the PDF within the user's browser window. It's important to note that while this feature is generally supported by contemporary, standards-compliant browsers, compatibility may vary across different web environments.

Here's the paraphrased content of the specified section with the resolved relative URL path:

```csharp
IronPdf.AspxToPdf.ConvertToPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileDisplayMode.InBrowser);
```

This code line utilizes the `IronPdf` library to convert an ASPX page to a PDF document that displays directly within a web browser window using the `InBrowser` display mode from the `FileDisplayMode` enumeration within the `AspxToPdf` class.

The "**Attachment**" setting prompts the PDF to be downloaded by the user.
```

```
IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.Attachment);
```

<h2>Transforming ASPX into PDF Documents</h2>

Microsoft's ASP.NET framework is widely used for crafting complex applications like online banking systems, intranets, and accounting software. A typical functionality in ASP.NET applications is producing dynamic PDFs such as invoices or reports that users can download.

This section explains how to use the IronPDF library to convert ASP.NET web forms into downloadable PDFs. The conversion uses the standard HTML output of web forms and changes it into a PDF, which can then be downloaded or viewed directly in browsers. The included source code demonstrates converting a standard web page into a PDF using C# within ASP.NET.

For this PDF generation, we utilize the `IronPDF` library, employing the `AspxToPdf` class from [**IronPDF's AspxToPdf**](https://ironsoftwar...

### 3.3. Modify PDF Printing Settings

Adjust the appearance and functionality of your PDF by employing the `IronPdf.ChromePdfRenderer` class:

Explore more details about this feature at [IronPdf.ChromePdfRenderer Documentation](https://ironpdf.com/object-reference/api/IronPdf.ChromePdfRenderer.html).

Here is the paraphrased section of the article with resolved relative URL paths:

```cs
using IronPdf;
namespace ironpdf.AspxToPdf
{
    public class Section3
    {
        public void Run()
        {
            var pdfOptions = new IronPdf.ChromePdfRenderOptions()
            {
                EnableJavaScript = false,
                // Additional options can be configured here
            };
            IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.Attachment, "Invoice.pdf", pdfOptions);
        }
    }
}
```

In this updated code snippet, I've changed the variable name to `pdfOptions` for clarity and noted where additional options could be set. The core function calls remain accurate, preserving the functional intent of converting a webpage to a PDF with specified settings.

The range of PDF rendering options available includes:

* **ApplyMarginToHeaderAndFooter**: This setting applies a margin to the HTML headers and footers. By default, it is set to false, meaning headers and footers will have no margin unless specified, and it is supported only in ChromeRender mode.

* **CreatePdfFormsFromHtml**: This function converts ASPX form elements into fillable PDF forms.

* **CssMediaType**: Allows the specification of media types such as "screen" or "print" for CSS styles and CSS3 style sheets.

* **CustomCssUrl**: Permits the application of a custom CSS style sheet to HTML content via a URL link.

* **EnableJavaScript**: Activates JavaScript, jQuery, and JSON code within the ASPX pages. Note, a render delay may need to be set to accommodate script execution.

* **FirstPageNumber**: Sets the starting page number for headers and footers, which by default is 1.

* **FitToPaperWidth**: When applicable, this condenses the PDF content to fit within the width of one virtual page.

* **GenerateUniqueDocumentIdentifiers**: If set to false, allows binary file comparisons of PDFs for purposes such as unit testing.

* **GrayScale**: Generates the PDF in grayscale, producing output in various shades of gray, rather than full color.

* **HtmlHeader**: Configures the header of each PDF page using either plain strings or HTML content.

* **TextHeader**: Configures the footer text of each PDF page, supporting mail merge functions and automatically converting URLs to hyperlinks.

* **HtmlFooter**: Determines the footer content for each PDF page using either strings or HTML.

* **TextFooter**: Sets the header text for each PDF page, also supporting mail merge and automatic hyperlink creation from URLs.

* **InputEncoding**: Specifies the character encoding for input, with UTF-8 set as the default for ASP.NET. [UTF-8 is Default for ASP.NET](https://ironpdf.com/how-to/utf-8/).

* **PaperMargins** (Left, Right, Top, Bottom): Defines the margins of the PDF paper in millimeters. Can be set to zero to create borderless PDF documents.

* **PaperOrientation**: Selects the orientation of the PDF paper, either *Landscape* or *Portrait*.

* **PaperSize**: Allows the selection of standard paper sizes using `System.Drawing.Printing.PaperKind` or sets a custom size via the `SetCustomPaperSize` method specifying width and height in integers.

* **PrintHtmlBackgrounds**: This option enables the printing of HTML background images in the PDF.

* **RenderDelay**: Designates a wait time, measured in milliseconds, required for HTML and scripts to render before the PDF is generated.

* **Timeout**: Specifies the maximum amount of time, in seconds, allowed for rendering before timing out.

* **Title**: Allows setting of the 'Title' metadata for the PDF document.

* **ViewportHeight** and **ViewportWidth**: Define the dimensions used to render HTML to PDF in IronPdf, measured in pixels.

* **Zoom**: Offers a percentage scale to adjust the HTML content size within the PDF, either enlarging or shrinking as needed. 

These settings give developers a comprehensive toolkit for customizing how ASPX is rendered into PDFs, enhancing both functionality and aesthetics.

## 4. Incorporating Headers and Footers in PDFs from ASPX Files

With IronPDF, it's straightforward to embed headers and footers into your PDF documents.

One of the easiest methods involves utilizing the `SimpleHeaderFooter` class. This class offers a straightforward layout that facilitates the inclusion of dynamic content like the current date and page numbers into the PDF headers and footers.

### 4.1. Example: Adding Headers and Footers to PDFs

Using IronPDF, you can enhance the presentation of your PDFs by incorporating customized headers and footers. Below is a practical example of how to implement this.

```cs
using IronSoftware.Drawing;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Web;
using System.Web.UI;
using System.Web.UI.WebControls;

namespace AspxToPdfTutorial
{
    public partial class Invoice : System.Web.UI.Page
    {
        protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            var options = new IronPdf.ChromePdfRenderOptions()
            {
                TextHeader = new IronPdf.TextHeaderFooter()
                {
                    CenterText = "Invoice",
                    DrawDividerLine = false,
                    Font = FontTypes.Arial,
                    FontSize = 12
                },
                TextFooter = new IronPdf.TextHeaderFooter()
                {
                    LeftText = "{date} - {time}",
                    RightText = "Page {page} of {total-pages}",
                    Font = IronSoftware.Drawing.FontTypes.Arial,
                    FontSize = 12,
                },
            };
            IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.Attachment, "Invoice.pdf", options);
        }
    }
}
```

Alternatively, you can employ HTML to create visually rich headers and footers:

```cs
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Web;
using System.Web.UI;
using System.Web.UI.WebControls;

namespace AspxToPdfTutorial
{
    public partial class Invoice : System.Web.UI.Page
    {
        protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            var options = new IronPdf.ChromePdfRenderOptions()
            {
                MarginTop = 50, // Ensure sufficient space for an HTML header
                HtmlHeader = new IronPdf.HtmlHeaderFooter()
                {
                    HtmlFragment = "<div style='text-align:right'><em style='color:pink'>page {page} of {total-pages}</em></div>"
                }
            };
            IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.Attachment, "MyDocument.pdf", options);
        }
    }
}
```

In these examples, placeholders such as `{page}`, `{total-pages}`, `{date}`, and `{time}` dynamically incorporate information about the PDF being viewed, improving both the functionality and the aesthetic of the document.

```cs
using IronSoftware.Drawing;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Web;
using System.Web.UI;
using System.Web.UI.WebControls;

namespace AspxToPdfTutorial
{
    public partial class Invoice : System.Web.UI.Page
    {
        protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            var pdfOptions = new IronPdf.ChromePdfRenderOptions()
            {
                TextHeader = new IronPdf.TextHeaderFooter()
                {
                    CenterText = "Invoice",
                    DrawDividerLine = false,
                    Font = FontTypes.Arial,
                    FontSize = 12
                },
                TextFooter = new IronPdf.TextHeaderFooter()
                {
                    LeftText = "{date} - {time}",
                    RightText = "Page {page} of {total-pages}",
                    Font = IronSoftware.Drawing.FontTypes.Arial,
                    FontSize = 12,
                },
            };
            IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.Attachment, "Invoice.pdf", pdfOptions);
        }
    }
}
```

This revised code block maintains the core functionality and presentation while subtly rephrasing certain elements, keeping consistency with the original context and requirements. The options for rendering the PDF are finely tuned to handle headers and footers as specified, including dynamic placeholders for adding up-to-date time and page numbers.

Another method for creating headers and footers in PDFs involves utilizing the `HtmlHeaderFooter` class from IronPDF. This approach supports the incorporation of CSS styles, images, and hyperlinks into your headers and footers for a more versatile and enriched document format.

Below is the paraphrased section of the article with relative URL paths resolved to ironpdf.com:

```cs
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Web;
using System.Web.UI;
using System.Web.UI.WebControls;

namespace AspxToPdfTutorial
{
    public partial class Invoice : System.Web.UI.Page
    {
        protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // Configure PDF conversion options
            var pdfOptions = new IronPdf.ChromePdfRenderOptions()
            {
                MarginTop = 50, // Allocate adequate space for the HTML header
                HtmlHeader = new IronPdf.HtmlHeaderFooter()
                {
                    HtmlFragment = "<div style='text-align:right;'><em style='color:pink;'>Page {page} of {total-pages}</em></div>"
                }
            };

            // Convert the current ASPX page into a PDF and save it as an attachment
            IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPdf(IronPdf.AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.Attachment, "MyDocument.pdf", pdfOptions);
        }
    }
}
```

In this version, comments have been added to enhance the understanding of the process involved in creating and manipulating PDF settings before rendering the ASPX page as a PDF document. Additionally, the code style and clarity were improved to aid readability.

In the demonstrations provided, you can dynamically integrate text or HTML into headers and footers by using placeholders, such as:

- `{page}`: Displays the current page number of the PDF.
- `{total-pages}`: Shows the complete number of pages in the PDF.
- `{date}`: Presents today's date, formatted according to the server's local settings.
- `{time}`: Indicates the current time in a 24-hour format (hours:minutes).
- `{html-title}`: Adds the title from the `<head>` tag of the ASPX web form into the document.
- `{pdf-title}`: Sets the document's filename as specified.

## 5. Implement Page Breaks in ASPX to PDF Conversion

Unlike HTML which typically extends into a continuous scrollable format, PDF documents are designed to mimic the layout of physical paper, thus pages in a PDF are of fixed length. To facilitate a page break in a PDF generated from an ASPX page, simply incorporate the following snippet into your ASPX code. This will instruct the rendering process to insert a page break at the specified position within the .NET PDF output.

```html
using IronPdf;
namespace ironpdf.AspxToPdf
{
    public class Section6
    {
        public void Run()
        {
            // This line inserts a page break in the generated PDF from the ASPX page
            <div style='page-break-after: always;'>&nbsp;</div>
        }
    }
}
```

<hr class="separator">

## 6. Optimize Performance with Async and Multithreading

IronPDF supports .NET Framework 4.0 and later, including .NET Core 2.0 and above. For projects targeting .NET Framework 4.5 and higher, leveraging [ASYNC](https://ironpdf.com/how-to/async/) can significantly enhance performance, particularly when handling multiple documents concurrently.

Using Async in combination with multicore processors and the `Parallel.ForEach` instruction can drastically heighten the efficiency of processing large volumes of PDFs.
