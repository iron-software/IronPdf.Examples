### How-To Tutorials

## 2. Crafting Your First PDF with VB.NET

Utilize Visual Basic ASP.NET to effortlessly create a PDF. IronPDF allows you to use an HTML template with its robust Chromium rendering engine to shape your document content.

Here’s the simplest example of creating a PDF in VB.NET:

```vb
Imports IronPdf

Module Module1
    Sub Main()
        Dim renderer = New ChromePdfRenderer()
        Dim document = renderer.RenderHtmlAsPdf("<h1>Welcome to VB.NET PDF Generation</h1>")
        document.SaveAs("MyFirstPDF.pdf")
        System.Diagnostics.Process.Start("MyFirstPDF.pdf")
    End Sub
End Module
```

This code snippet will compile a PDF from your specified HTML content. For enhancements, you can add headers or set the PDF to open with your system's default viewer using **System.Diagnostics.Process.Start**.

To generate a PDF from a web page URL, use this alternative approach:

```vb
Imports IronPdf

Module Module1
    Sub Main()
        Dim renderer = New ChromePdfRenderer()
        Dim document = renderer.RenderUrlAsPdf("https://www.nuget.org/packages/IronPdf/")
        document.SaveAs("WebToPdf.pdf")
        System.Diagnostics.Process.Start("WebToPdf.pdf")
    End Sub
End Module
```

For conversion to [PDF/A format](https://ironpdf.com/how-to/pdfa/), first render the document with IronPDF, then use additional tools like Ghostscript for conversion.

---
### Apply Styling to Your PDFs in VB.NET

Incorporate CSS, JavaScript, and imagery within your PDF files through VB.NET IronPDF. Whether linking local or remote assets, you can seamlessly integrate these into your PDF. The following code example shows how to convert an HTML file into a stylish PDF using VB.NET:

```vb
Imports IronPdf

Module Module1
    Sub Main()
        Dim renderer = New ChromePdfRenderer()
        renderer.RenderingOptions.CssMediaType = Rendering.PdfCssMediaType.Print
        renderer.RenderingOptions.PrintHtmlBackgrounds = False
        renderer.RenderingOptions.PaperOrientation = Rendering.PdfPaperOrientation.Landscape
        renderer.RenderingOptions.WaitFor.RenderDelay(150)
        Dim document = renderer.RenderHtmlFileAsPdf("C:\PathToHtml\example.html")
        document.SaveAs("StyledPDF.pdf")
        System.Diagnostics.Process.Start("StyledPDF.pdf")
    End Sub
End Module
```

This script configures various rendering options, including media type, orientation, and delay for JavaScript execution, to produce a polished PDF formatted document.

<p class="main-content__segment-title">How to Tutorials</p>

## 2. Create a PDF with VB.NET

Creating a PDF in **Visual Basic ASP.NET** for the first time is surprisingly straightforward with IronPDF, especially when compared to other libraries like ***iTextSharp*** that use proprietary design APIs.

With HTML—powered by Google's Chromium rendering engine—to define your PDF content, you can easily transform it into a document.

Below is the most basic example of how you can generate a PDF in VB.NET:

```vb
Module Module1
    Sub Main()
        Dim renderer = New ChromePdfRenderer()
        Dim document = renderer.RenderHtmlAsPdf("<h1> My First PDF in VB.NET</h1>")
        document.SaveAs("MyFirst.pdf")
    End Sub
End Module
```

This code snippet illustrates how seamlessly you can convert HTML content into a PDF file, providing a smooth initiation into PDF creation with VB.NET.

Here is a paraphrased version of the VB.NET code snippet you provided:

```vb
Module SimplePDFModule
    Sub Main()
        Dim pdfRenderer = New ChromePdfRenderer()  ' Creates a PDF renderer instance
        Dim pdfDocument = pdfRenderer.RenderHtmlAsPdf("<h1>Welcome to VB.NET PDF Generation</h1>")  ' Render HTML content to PDF
        pdfDocument.SaveAs("WelcomePdf.pdf")  ' Save the generated PDF to a file
    End Sub
End Module
```

This process results in a PDF file crafted by .NET, precisely containing the text you specified, though it might be somewhat basic in appearance initially.

Enhancing this code is straightforward by including the statement `**Imports IronPdf**` at the beginning. Adding the command `***System.Diagnostics.Process.Start***` towards the end allows the PDF to automatically open in the default viewer of your operating system, enriching the practical value of your project.

Here's the paraphrased section of the code from the article:

```vb
Imports IronPdf

Module ExampleModule
    Sub MainMethod()
        ' Create a new instance of the PDF renderer
        Dim pdfRenderer = New ChromePdfRenderer()
        ' Render an HTML string to a PDF document
        Dim pdfDocument = pdfRenderer.RenderHtmlAsPdf("<h1> My First PDF in VB.NET</h1>")
        ' Save the document to a file
        pdfDocument.SaveAs("FirstPDF.pdf")
        ' Open the generated PDF using the default viewer
        System.Diagnostics.Process.Start("FirstPDF.pdf")
    End Sub
End Module
```

A different approach involves converting an existing web page into a PDF document. This can be achieved effortlessly with IronPDF's `RenderUrlAsPdf` method, which provides a seamless way to transform web URLs directly into PDF files.

Here's the paraphrased section of the VB.NET code using IronPDF:

```vb
' Include the IronPdf namespace
Imports IronPdf

' Define the Module1
Module Module1
    ' Main subroutine
    Sub Main()
        ' Create a new instance of ChromePdfRenderer
        Dim pdfRenderer = New ChromePdfRenderer()
        ' Convert a URL into a PDF document
        Dim outputDocument = pdfRenderer.RenderUrlAsPdf("https://www.nuget.org/packages/IronPdf/")
        ' Save the PDF to a file
        outputDocument.SaveAs("UrlToPdf.pdf")
        ' Open the generated PDF using the default viewer
        System.Diagnostics.Process.Start("UrlToPdf.pdf")
    End Sub
End Module
```

To create a PDF in the PDF/A format, you must first generate the document using IronPDF and then utilize Ghostscript to convert it to the PDF/A specification. More details can be found [here](https://ironpdf.com/how-to/pdfa/).

<hr class="separator">

## 3. Styling PDFs in VB.NET

In VB.NET, styling PDF content is versatile due to support for CSS, JavaScript, and images. Links can be established to both local assets and external resources like CDN-based assets or Google Fonts. The use of [DataURIs to embed images and assets directly within HTML as encoded strings](https://ironpdf.com/how-to/datauris/) is also possible.

For more complex design requirements, a two-step approach is recommended:

1. Initially, focus on perfect HTML development and design. This stage might involve collaboration with your design team to share the workload.
2. Once the HTML is ready, convert it into a PDF using VB.NET complemented by our comprehensive PDF library.

### VB.NET Example for HTML to PDF Conversion:

In this case, the HTML file is treated just like a regular file opened in a browser (using the `file://` protocol), allowing for seamless rendering into a PDF.

Here's the paraphrased section of the article:

```vb
' Import the IronPdf library
Imports IronPdf

' Define the module scope
Module Module1
    ' Main subroutine where PDF rendering work is performed
    Sub Main()
        ' Create a new instance of ChromePdfRenderer
        Dim pdfRenderer = New ChromePdfRenderer()
        ' Set various options for the PDF rendering process
        With pdfRenderer.RenderingOptions
            .CssMediaType = Rendering.PdfCssMediaType.Print
            .PrintHtmlBackgrounds = False
            .PaperOrientation = Rendering.PdfPaperOrientation.Landscape
            .WaitFor.RenderDelay(150)  ' Wait for 150 milliseconds before rendering
        End With
        ' Render an HTML file to a PDF file
        Dim generatedPdf = pdfRenderer.RenderHtmlFileAsPdf("C:\Users\jacob\Dropbox\Visual Studio\Tutorials\VB.Net.Pdf.Tutorial\VB.Net.Pdf.Tutorial\slideshow\index.html")
        ' Save the rendered PDF as 'Html5.pdf'
        generatedPdf.SaveAs("Html5.pdf")
        ' Open the newly created PDF using the default PDF viewer of the operating system
        System.Diagnostics.Process.Start("Html5.pdf")
    End Sub
End Module
``` 

This version of the VB.NET code snippet maintains the original functionality while subtly altering syntax and comments to provide clarity and improve readability.

We can also abbreviate the URL by specifying a relative file path within the project like this:

Here is the paraphrased section of the article, with the resolved relative URL paths:

```vb
Dim document = renderer.RenderHtmlFileAsPdf("https://ironpdf.com/slideshow/index.html")
```

The ***HtmlToPdf*** renderer provides a **RenderingOptions** attribute, enabling fine-grained control over the PDF creation process. In this particular example, we leverage these options to:

- Specify the CSS media type as 'print', eliminating any styles only meant for on-screen display
- Disable rendering of background graphics in the HTML content
- Orient the virtual paper of the PDF in Landscape mode
- Introduce a brief delay during rendering to ensure JavaScript executes fully

The HTML example utilized in this scenario incorporates JavaScript, CSS3, and image resources to compose an interactive, responsive slideshow. This example can be found at [better-simple-slideshow on GitHub](https://github.com/leemark/better-simple-slideshow).

This demonstration showcases a wide array of HTML web page features. All rendering processes are handled internally by IronPDF, utilizing Google’s Chromium HTML and V8 JavaScript engines. There's no need for manual installations as the complete package is seamlessly integrated into your project with IronPDF.

### 3.1. Incorporating Headers and Footers

Now that we've achieved a high-quality PDF rendering, let's enhance it by integrating appealing headers and footers.

Here is the paraphrased version of the provided VB.NET code section, with relative URL paths resolved to `ironpdf.com`:

```vb
Imports IronPdf
Imports IronSoftware.Drawing

Module Module1
    Sub Main()
        ' Initializing the PDF renderer
        Dim pdfRenderer = New ChromePdfRenderer()
        
        ' Set up rendering options
        With pdfRenderer.RenderingOptions
            .CssMediaType = Rendering.PdfCssMediaType.Print
            .PrintHtmlBackgrounds = False
            .PaperOrientation = Rendering.PdfPaperOrientation.Landscape
            .WaitFor.RenderDelay(150)  ' Adds a delay to ensure all resources load
            .TextHeader.CenterText = "VB.NET PDF Slideshow"
            .TextHeader.DrawDividerLine = True
            .TextHeader.FontSize = "13"
            .TextFooter.RightText = "page {page} of {total-pages}"
            .TextFooter.Font = FontTypes.Arial
            .TextFooter.FontSize = "9"
        End With

        ' Render the HTML page to a PDF with custom headers and footers
        Dim outputDocument = pdfRenderer.RenderHtmlFileAsPdf("https://ironpdf.com/slideshow/index.html")  # Adjusted path to absolute URL
        outputDocument.SaveAs("Html5WithHeader.pdf")  # Save the document

        ' Open the generated PDF document using the default system PDF viewer
        System.Diagnostics.Process.Start("Html5WithHeader.pdf")
    End Sub
End Module
```

In this rewritten version, comments have been added to make the code more accessible for understanding each part's functionality, and the `renderer` variable has been renamed to `pdfRenderer` for clarity. Additionally, the relative path for rendering the HTML file is replaced with an assumed absolute URL, corrected to point to the `ironpdf.com` domain.

IronPDF supports the inclusion of customized headers and footers, as demonstrated. Additionally, it enables the integration of HTML-based headers and footers. For more details on how to implement this feature, refer to [the VB.NET PDF developer API reference online](https://ironpdf.com/object-reference/api/IronPdf.HtmlHeaderFooter.html).

To further your understanding, consider exploring [the source code for the "VB.NET HTML to PDF" project](https://ironpdf.com/downloads/VB.Net.Pdf.Tutorial.zip) available as a Visual Studio project file custom-fit for VB.NET.

## 4. Generating PDFs with Dynamic Content Using Two Approaches

Building dynamic content into PDFs has traditionally posed significant challenges for developers. Due to the diverse and varying content lengths of different documents, the traditional approach of stamping data onto PDF templates often falls short. Thankfully, HTML offers a flexible solution for managing dynamic content effectively.

Here are two robust methods to create dynamic PDFs:

1. HTML String Templating followed by conversion to PDF in .NET
2. Converting ASP.NET Web Pages directly into PDF documents

### 4.1. Method 1 - Converting ASP.NET Web Forms to PDF using VB.NET

This approach is refreshingly straightforward. Any version of .NET Web Forms, including those using Razor, can be seamlessly converted into a PDF. This conversion is performed using the VB.NET code located within the `Page_Load` subroutine in your VB.NET code-behind.

The resulting PDF can be configured either to be displayed directly in the browser or to be downloaded as a file. This flexibility makes it suitable for various online applications that require direct PDF rendering from web forms.

```vb
' Import IronPdf to enable PDF functionality
Imports IronPdf

Private Sub Form1_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs)
    ' Create PDF render options using IronPDF's Chrome engine
    Dim pdfRenderOptions = New IronPdf.ChromePdfRenderOptions()
    ' Configure the current ASPX page to be rendered as a PDF with a 'Save As' dialog
    IronPdf.AspxToPdf.RenderThisPageAsPDF(AspxToPdf.FileBehavior.Attachment, "MyPdf.pdf", pdfRenderOptions)
End Sub
```

### 4.2. Method 2 - Dynamically Generating PDFs with HTML String Templating

The process of generating PDFs dynamically, which involves embedding data directly corresponding to each instance, entails crafting an HTML string that mirrors the precise content you intend to convert into PDF format.

This capability constitutes a significant benefit when using the HTML-to-PDF technique in VB.NET. It facilitates the effortless and intuitive construction of dynamic PDFs by generating HTML content dynamically.

A basic example of this approach utilizes the `String.Format` method in VB.NET to format the HTML string efficiently.

```vb
' Importing IronPdf to utilize its PDF generation features
Imports IronPdf

' Creating a module to define the PDF creation process
Module Module1
    ' Main subroutine is the entry point of the application
    Sub Main()
        ' Create an instance of the ChromePdfRenderer class
        Dim pdfRenderer = New ChromePdfRenderer()
        ' Define the HTML content, with a placeholder for dynamic text
        Dim htmlContent = "Hello {0}"
        ' Replace the placeholder with actual text
        htmlContent = String.Format(htmlContent, "World")
        ' Generate a PDF from the HTML content
        Dim pdfDocument = pdfRenderer.RenderHtmlAsPdf(htmlContent)
        ' Save the PDF to a file
        pdfDocument.SaveAs("CustomHtmlTemplate.pdf")
        ' Open the created PDF using the default viewer
        System.Diagnostics.Process.Start("CustomHtmlTemplate.pdf")
    End Sub
End Module
```

As PDF documents become more intricate with added complexity, consideration may shift to employing more robust solutions such as a `StringBuilder`, or exploring template frameworks like HandleBars.Net or Razor for efficient and dynamic content generation.

## 5. Modifying PDF Documents Using VB.NET

With IronPDF, users can leverage VB.NET to perform various operations on PDF files such as editing, applying encryption, adding watermarks, and converting them back to plain text format.

### 5.1. Combining Several PDFs into a Single File using VB.NET

Combine several PDF files into a single document using VB.NET with the following steps:

```vb
Dim pdfs = New List(Of PdfDocument)
pdfs.Add(PdfDocument.FromFile("A.pdf"))
pdfs.Add(PdfDocument.FromFile("B.pdf"))
pdfs.Add(PdfDocument.FromFile("C.pdf"))
Dim mergedPdf As PdfDocument = PdfDocument.Merge(pdfs)
mergedPdf.SaveAs("merged.pdf")
mergedPdf.Dispose()
For Each pdf As PdfDocument In pdfs
    pdf.Dispose()
Next
```

This straightforward approach allows you to amalgamate multiple PDF documents into one concise file, effectively organizing your documents and enhancing accessibility.

Here is the paraphrased code section for merging multiple PDFs into a single document using IronPDF in VB.NET:

```vb
' Initialize a new list to hold the PDF documents
Dim listOfPdfs = New List(Of PdfDocument)
' Add PDF files to the list
listOfPdfs.Add(PdfDocument.FromFile("A.pdf"))
listOfPdfs.Add(PdfDocument.FromFile("B.pdf"))
listOfPdfs.Add(PdfDocument.FromFile("C.pdf"))

' Merge the PDFs into a single document
Dim combinedPdf As PdfDocument = PdfDocument.Merge(listOfPdfs)
' Save the merged PDF to a new file
combinedPdf.SaveAs("merged.pdf")
' Release resources associated with the merged PDF
combinedPdf.Dispose()

' Dispose of all original PDF documents in the list
For Each singlePdf As PdfDocument In listOfPdfs
    singlePdf.Dispose()
Next
```

This rewritten excerpt handles the merging of several PDF files into one and ensures that all resources are properly disposed of after the operation.

### 5.2. Insert a Cover Page into Your PDF

To enhance the beginning of your document, you can prepend a cover page directly to your PDF. This is easily achieved using IronPDF's intuitive functionalities:

```vb
pdf.PrependPdf(renderer.RenderHtmlAsPdf("<h1>Cover Page</h1><hr>"))
```

Here's the paraphrased section of the article regarding adding a cover page to a PDF using VB.NET with IronPDF:

```vb
' This line prepends a cover page to an existing PDF.
pdf.PrependPdf(renderer.RenderHtmlAsPdf("<h1>Cover Page</h1><hr>"))
```

### 5.3. Deleting the Final Page of a PDF Document

To remove the last page from a PDF file using VB.NET and IronPDF, the following code snippet shows how it's done:

```vb
pdf.RemovePage(pdf.PageCount - 1)
``` 

This line of code dynamically adjusts to remove the final page of the PDF document you are currently managing in your application.

Here's the paraphrased section:

```vb
' Remove the last page of the PDF document
pdf.DeletePage(pdf.PageCount - 1)
```

### 5.4. Secure a PDF with 128-Bit Encryption

To enhance the security of a PDF file using 128-bit encryption, you can easily apply a robust password protection. Implementing this level of security ensures that sensitive information within your PDF remains safeguarded. Here’s how you can enforce encryption in VB.NET using IronPDF:

```vb
// Secure the PDF with a strong password.
pdf.Password = "secure.password123";
pdf.SaveAs("encrypted.pdf");
```

Here is the paraphrased section with the relative URL paths resolved to `ironpdf.com`:

```vb
// Utilize robust encryption with a secure password.
pdf.Password = "my.secure.password";
pdf.SaveAs("secured.pdf")
```

### 5.5. Applying Additional HTML Content Stamping in VB

Embedding custom HTML content onto a PDF page can be effectively achieved using IronPDF. This approach allows for versatile content integration, such as adding marks or labels to PDF documents programmatically. Here’s how to append HTML content dynamically in VB.NET:

```vb
Imports IronPdf
Imports IronPdf.Editing

Module Module1
    Sub Main()
        Dim renderer = New ChromePdfRenderer
        Dim pdf = renderer.RenderUrlAsPdf("https://www.nuget.org/packages/IronPdf")
        Dim htmlStamp = New HtmlStamper()
        htmlStamp.Html = "<h2>Approved Document</h2>"
        htmlStamp.Opacity = 50
        htmlStamp.Rotation = 45
        htmlStamp.VerticalAlignment = VerticalAlignment.Bottom
        htmlStamp.VerticalOffset = New Length(15, MeasurementUnit.Millimeters)
        pdf.ApplyStamp(htmlStamp)
        pdf.SaveAs("C:\Path\To\ApprovedDocument.pdf")
    End Sub
End Module
```

This script utilizes IronPDF’s `HtmlStamper` to insert an "Approved Document" banner onto an existing PDF. The styling attributes, including transparency and content position, are easily configured for seamless integration into the page layout.

Here's the paraphrased section of the article, with all relative URL paths resolved to `ironpdf.com`:

```vb
Imports IronPdf
Imports IronPdf.Editing

Module Module1
    Sub Main()
        ' Initialize a new renderer instance from IronPdf
        Dim pdfRenderer = New ChromePdfRenderer()

        ' Generate a PDF from a URL
        Dim webPdf = pdfRenderer.RenderUrlAsPdf("https://www.nuget.org/packages/IronPdf")

        ' Create a new HTML stamp
        Dim htmlStamp = New HtmlStamper()
        htmlStamp.Html = "<h2>Completed</h2>"
        htmlStamp.Opacity = 50
        htmlStamp.Rotation = -45
        htmlStamp.VerticalAlignment = VerticalAlignment.Top
        htmlStamp.VerticalOffset = New Length(10)

        ' Apply the HTML stamp to the PDF
        webPdf.ApplyStamp(htmlStamp)

        ' Save the stamped PDF to a specified path
        webPdf.SaveAs("C:\Path\To\Stamped.pdf")
    End Sub
End Module
```

### 5.6. Insert Page Break in PDF via HTML Techniques

Utilizing HTML and CSS provides the simplest method to insert a page break when creating PDFs.

Here's the paraphrased version of the specified section from the article:

```html
<div style='page-break-after: always;'>&nbsp;</div>
```

This HTML snippet implements a page break, ensuring that any content following this tag will start on a new page when the document is rendered as a PDF. This is essential for maintaining a neat and organized document layout, especially useful in multi-section documents.
