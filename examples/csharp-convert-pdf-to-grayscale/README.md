When utilizing IronPDF to convert HTML content into a PDF, various properties of the `ChromePdfRenderer` class can be adjusted to tailor the resulting document to specific requirements. This customization can include adjustments to the paper size, DPI, as well as the addition of headers and footers, pertain to Chromium-based browser configurations. Moreover, IronPDF supports setting the PDF output to grayscale.

Below is a guide on how to produce a PDF in grayscale using IronPDF.

Transforming your document into grayscale modifies the appearance by transitioning the colors to varying shades of black and white. This adjustment simplifies the process of printing documents using monochrome printers. By default, the `ChromePdfRenderer` class does not produce documents in grayscale; you must enable this setting manually to achieve a black and white output.
