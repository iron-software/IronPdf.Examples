IronPDF excels in multi-threading and parallelism utilizing the Chrome Rendering Engine API from 2021. This enables developers to leverage the full multi-threading capabilities of their computers for quick task completion.

The following demonstrates how you can employ multiple threads for converting batches of HTML into PDF documents.

This technique could soon become a preferred method of utilizing multiple threads for batch conversion from HTML to PDF with IronPDF. Notably, IronPDF is designed to be thread-safe and fully supports multi-threading when utilizing the [`IronPdf.ChromePdfRenderer`](https://ironpdf.com/object-reference/api/IronPdf.ChromePdfRenderer.html) rendering engine. However, users should be aware of a specific limitation with multi-threading on macOS systems.

C#'s `Parallel.ForEach` function parallels what would traditionally be done in a sequential `foreach` loop. In the standard `foreach`, each iteration processes a single item at a time from the collection. Conversely, `Parallel.ForEach` performs multiple iterations simultaneously across different processors or cores. This approach introduces a risk of synchronization issues. As such, scenarios where each iteration is self-contained are ideal for this implementation.
