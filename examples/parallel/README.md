IronPDF leverages the modern 2021 Chrome Rendering API, enhancing its multithreading and parallel processing capabilities. Developers can utilize the full potential of their computing systems to expedite tasks using these features.

The following example illustrates how to employ multithreading for efficient batch conversion from HTML to PDF.

Using IronPDF's thread-safe features, particularly with the [`IronPdf.ChromePdfRenderer`](https://ironpdf.com/object-reference/api/IronPdf.ChromePdfRenderer.html) engine, can quickly become the preferred method for managing multithreaded batch processes. Note that while IronPDF excels in multithreaded environments, it does encounter some limitations on macOS systems regarding multithreading.

Instead of the basic sequential `foreach` loop, C# offers the `Parallel.ForEach` method for parallel execution. Where a standard `foreach` loop processes each collection item one after another, `Parallel.ForEach` executes multiple iterations simultaneously across different CPU cores or processors. This increases the potential for synchronization issues, making it essential for each iteration to be independent of the others for optimal usage of this method.
