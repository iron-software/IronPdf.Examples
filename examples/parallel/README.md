IronPDF features robust support for multithreading and parallel processing through its implementation of the 2021 Chrome Rendering API. This enhancement enables developers to maximize their computing resources by executing tasks more efficiently and quickly.

The following example illustrates how IronPDF can be utilized in scenarios where multiple threads are engaged for batch conversion of HTML to PDF.

This practice may soon become your preferred method for managing multithreaded batch processes for converting HTML to PDF. Notably, IronPDF is a thread-safe library that champions multithreaded operations using the [`IronPdf.ChromePdfRenderer`](https://ironpdf.com/object-reference/api/IronPdf.ChromePdfRenderer.html) renderer. However, itâ€™s important to note that multithreading limitations exist on macOS platforms.

In C#, multithreading in the form of the `Parallel.ForEach` method offers an alternative to the classic `foreach` loop. Typically, a `foreach` loop handles each item in the series sequentially, processing them one after another. Conversely, the `Parallel.ForEach` technique executes several iterations simultaneously across different processors or cores. This setup can introduce the risk of synchronization problems and is most effective in scenarios where each process iteration operates independently from the others.
