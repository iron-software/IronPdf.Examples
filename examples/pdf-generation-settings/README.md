IronPDF is designed to offer developers maximum flexibility.

In this [example](https://ironpdf.com/blog/using-ironpdf/csharp-generate-pdf-tutorial/), we illustrate how to strike a balance between an API that automates tasks and one that offers extensive control.

IronPDF allows for numerous customizations when creating PDF files. You can adjust page sizes, margins, header/footer content, scaling of content, CSS styles, and even execute JavaScript.

Developers can manage how Chrome renders a web page to a PDF thanks to the [`ChromePdfRenderer`](https://ironpdf.com/object-reference/api/IronPdf.ChromePdfRenderOptions.html) class.

The `ChromePDFRenderOptions` class offers several configuration options such as margins, headers, footers, paper sizing, and form creation settings.
