IronPDF is designed to offer the highest level of flexibility to developers.

In this [C# PDF Generation Tutorial Example](https://ironpdf.com/blog/using-ironpdf/csharp-generate-pdf-tutorial/), we illustrate the fine line between an API that manages internal processes automatically and one that allows developers to take the reins.

IronPDF permits extensive customization of the PDFs you generate, such as page size, margins, headers and footers, scaling of content, CSS styles, and JavaScript execution.

Our goal is for developers to have precise control over how Chrome converts web pages into PDF documents. The [`ChromePdfRenderer` Class Overview](https://ironpdf.com/object-reference/api/IronPdf.ChromePdfRenderOptions.html) enables this capability.

The `ChromePDFRenderOptions` class offers a variety of settings, including margins, headers, footers, paper dimensions, and options for creating forms.
