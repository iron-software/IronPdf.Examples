IronPDF recently added an intrinsic capability to manage different languages via Unicode. It seamlessly handles UTF-8 and Unicode characters, usually without requiring any additional setups.

Here's how you can leverage IronPDF's Unicode and UTF-8 support to include languages that utilize modern alphabets in your PDFs.

This technique is especially effective for incorporating languages such as:

- Hindi
- Various forms of Chinese
- Arabic
- Japanese
- Thai

For this feature to function correctly, your system should have Unicode fonts installed. On MacOS and Windows platforms, this installation is typically automatic. However, if you're using Linux, you might need to install these fonts manually with `apt-get`.

Another excellent strategy for ensuring flawless Unicode font rendering is by using Google Fonts. It is also advisable to include the `<meta charset="UTF-8">` tag or a similar setting when rendering files or URLs to enhance compatibility.

This functionality addresses the challenge of presenting multiple languages like Arabic or Chinese on the same PDF document and ensures smooth operation with URLs.
