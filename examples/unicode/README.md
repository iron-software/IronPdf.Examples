IronPDF has recently incorporated Unicode capabilities, enabling the rendering of multiple languages in PDFs effortlessly. This integration prominently includes support for both UTF-8 and Unicode characters, typically requiring no additional configuration.

Here is an example showcasing how to utilize the Unicode and UTF-8 support to present languages that utilize modern scripts in a PDF document.

The approach is frequently used for languages such as:

- Hindi
- Chinese (various dialects)
- Arabic
- Japanese
- Thai

For optimal functionality, it's essential to have Unicode fonts installed on your system. Generally, systems like Mac and Windows automatically handle this. On Linux, however, Unicode fonts might require manual installation via commands like `apt-get`.

Another excellent strategy for flawless Unicode font rendering is using Google Fonts. Additionally, it's advisable to include `<meta charset="UTF-8">` in your documents or when processing URLs to ensure correct character encoding.

This method is particularly effective for displaying languages such as Arabic and Chinese on the same PDF, and it enhances URL compatibility as well.
