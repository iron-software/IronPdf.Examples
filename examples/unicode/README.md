IronPDF now seamlessly integrates Unicode support, facilitating the rendering of various languages directly into a PDF without any additional configuration. Supporting both UTF-8 and Unicode characters, IronPDF makes multi-language document creation straightforward.

Here is a demonstration of leveraging Unicode & UTF-8 support to depict languages based on modern alphabets in a PDF document:

This functionality is particularly useful for languages including:

- Hindi
- Various Chinese dialects
- Arabic
- Japanese
- Thai

It is necessary that your system has Unicode fonts installed for this feature to function correctly. Installation is typically automatic on Mac and Windows operating systems. On Linux systems, however, you might need to manually install these fonts using the `apt-get` command.

Another excellent method to guarantee flawless rendering of Unicode fonts is by utilizing Google Fonts. Moreover, itâ€™s advisable to include `<meta charset="UTF-8">` or a similar setting when rendering files or URLs.

Adopting this encoding approach resolves challenges associated with displaying languages such as Arabic and Chinese on a single PDF document, and it is effective for URLs as well.
