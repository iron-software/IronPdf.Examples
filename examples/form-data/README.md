IronPDF empowers you to craft editable PDF documents as effortlessly as working with typical text documents. The `PdfForm` class encompasses a suite of editable fields within a PDF, allowing it to function either as a form or a modifiable document.

Hereâ€™s a guide on generating PDF forms that users can edit using IronPDF.

Creating PDFs with modifiable forms is straightforward: you simply incorporate `<form>`, `<input>`, and `<textarea>` tags within the HTML content.

To modify or read values from form fields, utilize the `PdfDocument.Form.GetFieldByName` method. This field's identifier corresponds to the 'name' attribute you assign within your HTML.

Additionally, the `PdfDocument.Form` object serves dual purposes:

- Firstly, it seeds default values into form fields which, when opened with Adobe Reader, display these predefined entries.
- Secondly, it provides the functionality to extract data from PDF forms that have been completed by users, supporting multiple languages.
