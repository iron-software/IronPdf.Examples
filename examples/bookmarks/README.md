A PDF outline, commonly referred to as a "bookmark," facilitates easy navigation to important pages within a PDF. In applications like Adobe Acrobat Reader, these bookmarks—capable of being nested—appear on the left sidebar. IronPDF, a product from Iron Software, not only supports the importation of existing bookmarks from PDFs but also allows users to add, modify, and nest bookmarks further.
