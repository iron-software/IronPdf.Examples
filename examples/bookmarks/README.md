A PDF bookmark, also known as an "outline," offers a convenient method for quickly accessing important sections within a PDF document. In the Adobe Acrobat Reader, these bookmarks, which can be organized hierarchically, appear in the left sidebar of the application. IronPDF is capable of importing any bookmarks that are present in PDF documents and provides functionality to add, modify, and organize these bookmarks as needed.
