IronPDF offers a comprehensive solution for PDF rendering that fully supports JavaScript within HTML, including widely-used frameworks like Angular.js and other prominent front-end web technologies.

If it functions correctly in Google Chrome, then it will function correctly in IronPDF!

The demonstration below illustrates how to utilize Angular.js and other renowned single-page and front-end web frameworks for rendering PDFs in Chrome.

By employing the `RenderDelay` setting, IronPDF allows a waiting period for the asynchronous content to load as needed. In this instance, we set a delay of half a second. This PDF rendering capability in Chrome is compatible with a variety of frameworks, allowing you to choose the one that best suits your needs:

- Angular.js
- Aurelia
- Vue.js
- React
- Mithril
- Riot
- Knockout
- Kendo
- Backbone

IronPDF recognizes the needs of developers to craft customized PDF documents that meet the precise expectations of their users. Using the Angular.js framework enhances your capability to design your PDFs in Chrome just as you envisage them.

This approach ensures that the resulting PDF documents are an exact visual match to what you would see within the Google Chrome browser's PDF functionality.
