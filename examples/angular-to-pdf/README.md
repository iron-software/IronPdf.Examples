IronPDF offers a comprehensive solution equipped to handle PDF rendering by using JavaScript within HTML, supporting various frameworks such as Angular.js and many others used in single-page and front-end development.

If it functions in Chrome, it will function in IronPDF!

Below is an example demonstrating how to employ Angular.js and other leading single-page and front-end web frameworks for your PDF rendering operations in Chrome.

IronPDF includes a `RenderDelay` option, permitting developers to allocate time for asynchronous content to load. In the following example, a delay of half a second is used. The PDF rendering capability in Chrome further supports numerous frameworks, allowing you to choose the one that best fits your needs:

- Angular.js
- Aurelia
- Vue.js
- React
- Mithril
- Riot
- Knockout
- Kendo
- Backbone

Iron Software recognizes that developers might prefer to tailor PDF documents to meet specific customer expectations. This customization can be accomplished through the [Angular.js PDF rendering feature in IronPDF](https://ironpdf.com/javascript-to-pdf/), enabling you to achieve the desired appearance directly in Chrome.

Utilizing this approach, the resulting PDF documents will be identical, down to the pixel, to those seen in the Google Chrome web browser.
