IronPDF allows you to digitally sign PDF documents, either new or existing, using `.pfx` and `.p12` `X509Certificate2` digital certificates.

When a PDF is signed, any modifications will invalidate the certificate, assuring document integrity.

For instructions on creating a signing certificate at no cost using Adobe Reader, refer to [Adobe's guide on digital IDs](https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/using/digital-ids.html).

Besides digital cryptographic signatures, IronPDF also supports appending a scanned handwritten signature or a company seal as a method for signing PDFs.

Access a demo project that illustrates how to digitally sign PDFs with IronPDF by downloading the [IronPDF digitally sign PDF sample project](https://ironpdf.com/downloads/digitally-sign-pdf.zip).
