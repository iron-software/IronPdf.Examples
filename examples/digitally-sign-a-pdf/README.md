IronPDF provides the ability to digitally sign both newly created and existing PDF files using `.pfx` and `.p12` `X509Certificate2` digital certificates.

Once signed, any modifications to the PDF will invalidate the certificate, thus maintaining the documentâ€™s authenticity.

Additionally, IronPDF allows the use of handwritten signatures or company stamps as part of the PDF signing process.
