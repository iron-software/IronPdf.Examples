IronPDF provides functionality to digitally sign both new and existing PDF files utilizing .pfx and .p12 X509Certificate2 digital certificates.

Once signed, any alterations to the PDF will invalidate the certificate, maintaining the documentâ€™s integrity.

For instructions on how to create a signing certificate at no cost via Adobe Reader, have a look at [Adobe's guide on digital IDs](https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/using/digital-ids.html).

Beyond cryptographic signing, IronPDF allows incorporating images of handwritten signatures or company seals as part of the PDF signing process.
