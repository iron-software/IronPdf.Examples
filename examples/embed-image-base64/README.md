Embedding an image in HTML using base64 encoding involves several critical steps. Initially, you must collect the binary data of the image, either by reading it from a file or by obtaining it through a network request. Next, use the `.NET` `Convert.ToBase64String` method to convert this binary data into base64 format. When you create your HTML image tag, begin with "data:image/svg+xml;base64," and then append the base64-encoded data. It's critical to specify the image type at the start of the base64 data string. For more information on different image formats, you can check out the [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types).
