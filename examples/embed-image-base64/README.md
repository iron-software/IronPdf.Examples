To insert an image into HTML using base64 encoding, begin by obtaining the image's binary data, which can be done by either loading the image file or acquiring it via network communication. Once you have the binary data, use the `.NET` method `Convert.ToBase64String` to convert this data into a base64 string. When writing the HTML image tag, you should prepend "data:image/svg+xml;base64," to the beginning of the base64 string. It's crucial to specify the type of the image precedingly to introducing the base64 content. To delve deeper into various image format types, you might want to view the [MDN Web Docs on Image Types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types).
