The code snippet provided below outlines a well-structured method for transforming DOCX files into PDF format.

Begin the process of converting Microsoft Word documents to PDF by initializing an instance of the `DocxToPdfRenderer` class. This class is pivotal in accessing a variety of features for converting DOCX to PDF. By utilizing the `RenderDocxAsPdf` method, and specifying the path to the original DOCX file, a `PdfDocument` object representing the converted PDF is returned.

Once your PDF has been created, you can further refine and manipulate the document. This entails functions such as exporting the PDF as [PDF/A](https://ironpdf.com/how-to/pdfa/) or [PDF/UA](https://ironpdf.com/how-to/pdfua/), and securing your document by appending a [digital certificate](https://ironpdf.com/how-to/signing/).

In addition to converting your DOCX files, the flexibility of the process allows you to make more tailored modifications to the PDF according to your precise requirements.
