The provided code sample outlines a detailed method for transforming documents from DOCX to PDF format.

To start the conversion from Microsoft Word to PDF, initiate by creating an instance of the `DocxToPdfRenderer` class. This class acts as the primary interface for all DOCX to PDF conversion functionalities. By executing the `RenderDocxAsPdf` method with the path of the source DOCX file provided, a `PdfDocument` object, which contains the converted PDF document, is returned.

Once the conversion produces the PDF document, you can further modify the PDF. You can perform various enhancements, including converting the PDF to standards such as [PDF/A](https://ironpdf.com/how-to/pdfa/) or [PDF/UA](https://ironpdf.com/how-to/pdfua/), or securing the PDF by embedding a [digital certificate](https://ironpdf.com/how-to/signing/).

The process not only allows converting DOCX to PDF but also enables modifications to the PDF post-conversion according to your specific requirements.
