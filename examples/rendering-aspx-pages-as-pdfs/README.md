Employing the IronPDF library, ASP.NET web pages can be easily converted to PDF format instead of HTML by merely incorporating a single line of code into the **`Form_Load`** event.

This example demonstrates how IronPDF can generate sophisticated, data-driven PDFs that are initially crafted and evaluated as HTML for ease of use.

IronPDFâ€™s [ASPX to PDF](https://ironpdf.com/how-to/aspx-to-pdf/) feature enables you to invoke a single method within an ASPX page, allowing the page to output a PDF file rather than HTML.

You have the option to configure the PDF either to be displayed "in-browser," or to function as a downloadable file.
