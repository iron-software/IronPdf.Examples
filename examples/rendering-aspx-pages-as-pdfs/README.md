Utilizing the IronPDF library, ASP.NET web pages can easily transform into PDF format by incorporating just one line of code into the **`Form_Load`** event.

This case illustrates how IronPDF effortlessly enables the production of intricate, data-rich PDFs, initially crafted and evaluated in HTML for ease.

IronPDFâ€™s [ASPX to PDF Conversion](https://ironpdf.com/how-to/aspx-to-pdf/) feature provides the capability to execute a single method within an ASPX page, leading to the generation of a PDF instead of HTML.

You have the flexibility to program the PDF either to be displayed directly in the browser or to be treated as a file download.
