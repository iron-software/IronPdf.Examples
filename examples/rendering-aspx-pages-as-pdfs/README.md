Using the IronPDF library, ASP.NET web pages can be converted to PDF with just a simple code addition in the **`Form_Load`** event.

The following example demonstrates how IronPDF can be employed to generate sophisticated, data-centric PDFs that are initially created and verified using HTML for ease.

With IronPDFâ€™s [ASPX to PDF Conversion](https://ironpdf.com/how-to/aspx-to-pdf/) feature, invoking a single method on an ASPX page enables it to output a PDF rather than HTML.

This conversion allows for the PDF to be configured either to be displayed directly in the browser or to be downloaded as a file.
