The following C# code snippet demonstrates how to convert a PDF document to HTML using IronPDF.

For additional insights into this conversion technique, please see [IronPDF's PDF to HTML Conversion Documentation](https://ironpdf.com/docs/#pdf-to-html).

To tailor the HTML output to your needs, the `HtmlFormatOptions` class is available. This class offers various settings that you can adjust, including background color, the color of heading (H1), font size, and text alignment.

For more details on customization, please refer to the [IronPDF HTML Styling Guide](https://ironpdf.com/docs/#html-styling).

It's important to note that once a PDF is converted to HTML, any interactive forms present in the original PDF will not remain functional in the HTML output.
