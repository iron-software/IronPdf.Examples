This example illustrates the process of converting a MAUI page to a PDF file.

The `IronPdf.Extensions.Maui` package extends the functionality of the primary `IronPdf` library. To convert a content page from a MAUI application into a PDF, you must include both the `IronPdf` and `IronPdf.Extensions.Maui` packages in your project.
