This tutorial illustrates how to transform a MAUI page into a PDF file using IronPdf.

Utilizing the `IronPdf.Extensions.Maui` package, which complements the core IronPdf library, is essential for converting a MAUI application's content page into a PDF format. Both the `IronPdf.Extensions.Maui` and `IronPdf` packages must be incorporated for this functionality.

When you convert a MAUI page into PDF, you'll be able to leverage all the capabilities provided by the `RenderingOptions` class. Once converted, the PDF document can be saved as a file or displayed within a MAUI PDF viewer, accessible at [MAUI PDF viewer](https://ironpdf.com/tutorials/pdf-viewing/).
