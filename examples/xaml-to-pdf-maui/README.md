This sample showcases the process of transforming a MAUI page into a PDF file.

The `IronPdf.Extensions.Maui` library is an addition to the core `IronPdf` package. To convert a content page from a MAUI application to a PDF, it is essential to incorporate both the `IronPdf.Extensions.Maui` and `IronPdf` libraries.

When converting a MAUI page, you can take advantage of the comprehensive functionalities provided by the `RenderingOptions` class. Once converted, the PDF document can be saved as a file or displayed using a [MAUI PDF viewer](https://ironpdf.com/tutorials/pdf-viewing/).
