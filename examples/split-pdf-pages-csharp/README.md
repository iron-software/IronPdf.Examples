IronPDF enables the division of PDF files, allowing for the isolation of specific pages or page spans into new `IronPdf.PdfDocument` instances.

The method provided by the C# .NET API for this functionality is `IronPdf.PdfDocument.CopyPage`. This process can also be referred to as _Page Extraction_, where pages from one or several PDFs are segmented into a fresh document.
