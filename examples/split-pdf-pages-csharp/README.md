IronPDF provides functionality to segment PDF files by splitting them into individual pages or ranges of pages, which are then instantiated as new `IronPdf.PdfDocument` objects.

The method provided by the C# .NET API for this operation is `IronPdf.PdfDocument.CopyPage`. This process can be described as _Extracting Pages_ where pages from one or several PDF files are compiled into a new PDF document.
