IronPDF empowers developers to effortlessly generate PDF documents using C#, F#, and VB.NET across both .NET Core and .NET Framework platforms.

This example illustrates how a PDF document can be generated from any HTML source, enabling the creation of PDFs that seamlessly align with the branding of existing websites.

Developers can opt for straightforward HTML, or enhance their documents with CSS, images, and JavaScript to enrich the presentation.

IronPDF leverages a [pixel-perfect](https://ironpdf.com/how-to/pixel-perfect-html-to-pdf/) Chrome rendering engine to convert HTML5 enhanced with CSS3 and JavaScript into PDF documents. This conversion can process HTML content provided as strings, external files, or URLs, all of which IronPDF can effortlessly render into PDF format.
