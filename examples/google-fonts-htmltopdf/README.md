Utilizing custom fonts can significantly enhance the appearance of your PDFs, allowing your documents to carry a unique style that reflects your organization's branding. This comprises the integration of specific fonts and tailored icons or graphics prominent to your brand identity. Luckily, IronPDF extends robust support for web fonts, including the extensive collection available through Google Fonts.

Here’s how you can implement your own custom fonts in PDFs, taking advantage of the IronPDF's custom font support functionalities.

This feature grants developers complete control over font selection, liberating them from the constraints of only using default System fonts.

However, incorporating custom fonts into your PDFs requires attention to a minor complication: the necessity of a `RenderDelay`. Additionally, due to Microsoft’s security measures, web fonts are incompatible with Azure's shared Windows Web App hosting.

Supported Web Fonts Include:

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
- [Bootstrap Glyphs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/)
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
- [Barcode Fonts](https://ironpdf.com/examples/barcode-htmltopdf/)
- Any custom CSS font packages you create, whether they're WOFF or SVG-based.
