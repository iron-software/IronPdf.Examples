Custom fonts are essential for creating PDFs that reflect a specific aesthetic or branding. Businesses and organizations often incorporate custom fonts along with bespoke icons or imagery to promote their unique identity. IronPDF extends support to web fonts, including the vast collection available from the Google Fonts library.

The following example demonstrates how to integrate custom fonts into your PDF documents using IronPDF's capability to handle custom fonts.

This functionality allows developers to have complete control over font selection, moving beyond the default System typefaces.

Nonetheless, there is a minor complication when using custom fonts in your PDF documents; it necessitates a `RenderDelay`. Additionally, due to security policies of Microsoft, web fonts are incompatible with Azure shared Windows Web App hosting.

Supported Web Fonts Include:
