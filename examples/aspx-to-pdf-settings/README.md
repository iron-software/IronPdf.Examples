This sample showcases how to modify PDF print settings to transform a form into HTML format.

IronPDF's [ASPX to PDF](https://ironpdf.com/how-to/aspx-to-pdf/) feature offers a multitude of settings for converting HTML to PDF, whether from a direct string input or from a file.

There are two particularly significant settings:

- Permitting developers to decide whether HTML forms are converted into interactive PDF forms.
- Allowing developers to choose whether the PDF is presented "in browser" or available as a file download.
