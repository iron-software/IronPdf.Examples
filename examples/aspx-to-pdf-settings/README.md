The following example illustrates how to modify PDF print settings to convert a form into HTML.

Using IronPDF, the [ASPX to PDF Conversion Guide](https://ironpdf.com/how-to/aspx-to-pdf/) provides various settings for converting HTML to PDF from either a string or a file.

Two settings are especially crucial:

- Enabling developers to decide whether HTML forms should be converted into interactive PDF forms.
- Enabling developers to choose if the PDF should be viewed "in browser" or as a downloadable file.
