Documents that require the incorporation of graphs, such as those used in mathematical or statistical analyses, can be effectively managed with IronPDF. This tool robustly supports JavaScript in [HTML to PDF conversion](https://ironpdf.com/tutorials/html-to-pdf/), ensuring elements like canvas and charts are accurately rendered.

The `IronPdf.ChromePdfRenderer` extends this functionality, providing enhanced capabilities for 3D charts and polygon graphics, elevating the standard of visual rendering in PDFs.

Here's how you can employ IronPDF to output charts, canvases, and 3D graphics into PDF format:

Included among the supported chart types are:

- C3.js
- D3.js
- Highcharts

Moreover, [IronPDF's Pixel-Perfect Chrome Rendering](https://ironpdf.com/how-to/pixel-perfect-html-to-pdf/) delivers flawless execution with complete JavaScript integration, making it an exceptional choice for producing graphically rich documents.

For configuring HTML to PDF conversion settings, the `ChromePdfRenderer` offers various options such as choosing the Paper Size, setting the DPI, and customizing Headers and Footers, alongside other Chromium-specific browser configurations.

The recent addition of WebGL support significantly enhances this feature, enabling quick and precise rendering of both 3D charts and complex polygons directly within documents.
