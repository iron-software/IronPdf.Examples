Generating a blank PDF page involves creating a page within a PDF file that lacks any content, such as text, images, or graphics. This is typically done for specific reasons, including providing extra space for annotations, dividing segments within the document, or structuring content according to a certain layout.

Using IronPDF to construct a PDF with an empty page is quite simple. For further information on how to utilize IronPDF for creating PDF files, you can refer to the [IronPDF Official Documentation](https://ironpdf.com/docs/). To initiate a new PDF containing a blank page, just pass two integers representing the width and height to the `PdfDocument` constructor.
