Generating a blank PDF page means creating an empty page in a PDF document devoid of any text, images, or graphical content. This is often done deliberately to serve various needs like providing space for annotations, dividing document sections, or organizing content with particular layouts.

Creating a PDF that includes a blank page is easily accomplished with IronPDF. For comprehensive instructions on utilizing IronPDF to create PDF files, you can explore the [IronPDF Official Documentation](https://ironpdf.com/docs/). Just provide two integers specifying the width and height when invoking the `PdfDocument` constructor, and a PDF with a blank page will be created smoothly.
