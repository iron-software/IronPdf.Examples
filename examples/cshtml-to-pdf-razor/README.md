The following code snippet illustrates how to transform Razor pages into PDF documents.

If you plan to incorporate this functionality within an ASP.NET Core Web Application, you should install two important packages: `IronPdf.Extensions.Razor` and `IronPdf`. These libraries collectively facilitate the conversion of Razor pages to PDF format.

Utilizing Razor pages for conversion lets you leverage the comprehensive features offered by the `**RenderingOptions**` class, enhancing the customization and further modification or export of the generated PDF files.
