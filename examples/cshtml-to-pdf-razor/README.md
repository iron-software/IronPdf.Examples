The following code snippet illustrates how to transform a Razor page into a PDF document.

In an ASP.NET Core Web application, you need to install two packages: `IronPdf.Extensions.Razor` and `IronPdf`. These packages collaborate to facilitate the conversion of Razor pages into PDF documents.

Utilizing Razor pages for rendering allows you to harness the comprehensive capabilities of the `**RenderingOptions**` class. You can then modify or export the created PDF document as required.
