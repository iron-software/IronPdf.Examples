This code sample illustrates how to transform a Razor page into a PDF document.

In order to perform this task within an ASP.NET Core Web Application, install two specific packages: `IronPdf.Extensions.Razor` and `IronPdf`. These libraries collaborate to allow the conversion of Razor pages to PDF format.

Utilizing the HTML-to-PDF conversion on Razor pages allows you to leverage the comprehensive functionalities offered by the `**RenderingOptions**` class. You can then further customize or distribute the generated PDF document as required.
