Utilizing IronPDF to convert HTML files into PDFs is remarkably straightforward.

IronPDF is capable of processing any HTML file stored on your system.

In this [example](https://ironpdf.com/tutorials/html-to-pdf/), we demonstrate that all embedded resources like CSS, images, and JavaScript are treated as though the HTML was accessed using the `file://` protocol.

This approach offers developers the flexibility to review their HTML content in a web browser while developing. This is especially useful for validating the accuracy of the content rendering. It is suggested to use Chrome for these tests since IronPDFâ€™s rendering engine is designed to emulate Chrome's rendering.

If your HTML appears correctly in Chrome, it will be [exactly replicated](https://ironpdf.com/how-to/pixel-perfect-html-to-pdf/) in your IronPDF output.
