Using IronPDF to transform HTML into PDFs is straightforward, especially when dealing with HTML files stored on your computer.

IronPDF is adept at processing any local HTML file.

Our [HTML to PDF tutorial](https://ironpdf.com/tutorials/html-to-pdf/) explains how IronPDF handles all relative assets, such as CSS, images, and JavaScript. They are processed as though the HTML file is accessed through the `file://` protocol.

This functionality allows developers to easily verify and adjust HTML content directly in a web browser, fundamentally enhancing their testing process. This is particularly useful for confirming visual accuracy in renderings. We suggest using Chrome for such testing tasks, as IronPDF's rendering technology is built to emulate Chrome's rendering behavior.

Thus, if your content looks accurate in Chrome, you can expect a [pixel-perfect rendition in PDF format](https://ironpdf.com/how-to/pixel-perfect-html-to-pdf/) via IronPDF.
