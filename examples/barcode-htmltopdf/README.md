IronPDF not only supports standard custom fonts but also encompasses web fonts, including [Barcode Fonts with IronPDF](https://ironpdf.com/examples/barcode-htmltopdf/), allowing effortless incorporation of barcode data into your PDF projects. This capability provides developers with the tools needed to integrate barcodes directly into PDF documents.

This guide illustrates the process of embedding barcodes into your PDFs using IronPDF.

However, it's important to note that some specific barcode types, like QR codes, might not be directly supported. In these instances, you can utilize [IronOCR to generate barcodes](https://ironsoftware.com/csharp/ocr/), then integrating these barcodes as images within your PDFs.

For further customization, you can explore Google Fonts, which offers 7 distinct Google WebFont-based styles for barcode rendering. Be aware, though, that using barcode fonts comes with certain constraints, such as the requirement for a `RenderDelay`. Moreover, web fonts may face compatibility issues on Azure shared Windows Web App hosting due to Microsoft's security policies.
