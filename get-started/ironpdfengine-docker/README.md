# Utilizing IronPDF in a Remote Docker Container

***Based on <https://ironpdf.com/get-started/ironpdfengine-docker/>***


IronPdfEngine functions as a self-sufficient service capable of handling the creation, manipulation, and retrieval of PDF documents. Docker containers pre-configured for IronPDF are available, compatible from version v2023.2.x onwards, aimed at helping developers overcome frequent deployment challenges related to IronPDF.

## Benefits of Isolating IronPDF in a Docker Container

IronPDF relies on extensive binaries from Chrome and Pdfium, which are largeâ€”in the realm of hundreds of megabytes. Additionally, it depends on numerous system dependencies.

This architecture means that deploying IronPDF in a standalone container significantly reduces the footprint on client systems.

### Simplifying Deployment

Setting up a local environment to include all necessary dependencies can be daunting. By utilizing the IronPDF Docker container, these components are already configured and ready to perform, ensuring a smooth and trouble-free deployment process.

## Versioning Conventions

Each version of IronPDF has a matching IronPdfEngine Docker tag which must align with the IronPDF version used in your environment.

For instance, `IronPDF for Java` version `2023.2.1` should match IronPdfEngine version `2023.2.1`. Version mismatches between IronPdfEngine and IronPDF are not supported.

## Deploying IronPDF with Docker

### Step 1 - Integration of IronPDF

Integrate IronPdf.Slim from NuGet into your project.

[https://www.nuget.org/packages/IronPdf.Slim/](https://www.nuget.org/packages/IronPdf.Slim/)

| More details at: [https://ironpdf.com/docs/](https://ironpdf.com/docs/)

**Note: The `IronPdf`, `IronPdf.Linux`, and `IronPdf.MacOs` packages include the `IronPdf.Slim`.** For minimized application size, it's recommended to just use `IronPdf.Slim`.

### Step 2 - Identify the Appropriate Container Version

The version for the IronPDF Docker offering is directly taken from the latest NuGet listing of IronPDF.

To manually verify the version, use:

```cs
string ironPdfEngineVersion = IronPdf.Installation.IronPdfEngineVersion;
```

### Step 3 - Configuring IronPDF in a Docker Container

#### Without Docker Compose:

Deploy the container with a specific version:

Example for `IronPDF for Docker version e.g. 2023.2.1`:

```bash
docker network create -d bridge --attachable --subnet=172.19.0.0/16 --gateway=172.19.0.1 ironpdf-network

docker run -d -e IRONPDF_ENGINE_LICENSE_KEY=MY_LICENSE_KEY --network=ironpdf-network --ip=172.19.0.2 --name=ironpdfengine --hostname=ironpdfengine -p 33350:33350 ironsoftwareofficial/ironpdfengine:2023.2.1
```

The port `33350` serves as the standard internal port for IronPdfEngine.

#### Using Docker Compose:

Create your Docker Compose setup as per this template:

```yaml
version: "3.3"

services:
  ironpdfengine:
    container_name: ironpdfengine
    image: ironsoftwareofficial/ironpdfengine:latest
    networks:
      ironpdf-network:
        ipv4_address: 172.19.0.2
  myconsoleapp:
    container_name: myconsoleapp
    build:
      context: ./MyConsoleApp/
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    networks:
      ironpdf-network:
        ipv4_address: 172.19.0.3
    depends_on:
      ironpdfengine:
        condition: service_started

networks:
  ironpdf-network:
    driver: bridge
    ipam:
      config:
        - subnet: 172.19.0.0/16
          gateway: 172.19.0.1
```

Execute the following to start your services:

```bash
docker compose up --detach --force-recreate --remove-orphans --timestamps
```

### Step 4 - Setting Up the IronPDF Client Configuration

Include this code snippet:

```cs
using IronPdf.GrpcLayer;

var config = new IronPdfConnectionConfiguration();
config.ConnectionType = IronPdfConnectionType.Docker;
IronPdf.Installation.ConnectToIronPdfHost(config);
```

### Step 5 - Execution

Now execute your IronPDF related operations; the application will communicate with the IronPdfEngine running inside the Docker container.

#### Example Client Code

```cs
using IronPdf;
using IronPdf.GrpcLayer;

var config = new IronPdfConnectionConfiguration();
config.ConnectionType = IronPdfConnectionType.Docker;
IronPdf.Installation.ConnectToIronPdfHost(config);

ChromePdfRenderer renderer = new ChromePdfRenderer();
PdfDocument pdf = renderer.RenderHtmlAsPdf("<h1>Hello IronPDF Docker!</h1>");
pdf.SaveAs("ironpdf.pdf");
```
